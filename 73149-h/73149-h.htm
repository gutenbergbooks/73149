<p><i>Joseph Hergesheimer</i> writes:</p>

<p>“The solid accomplishment of Miss
Delafield’s three novels establishes her as
a figure of actual literary importance.
Writing, from her first published sentence
to the ending phrase of <i>The Pelicans</i>,
with a delicate mastery and finish, she
expresses her witty and forceful personality
with the utmost clearness.</p>

<p><i>Zella Sees Herself</i>, <i>The War Workers</i>,
and <i>The Pelicans</i> offer to honest and
intelligent people an enjoyment of what
are recognized as really high traits of
creative literature together with a pervading
amusement and lively interest
sustained from paragraph to paragraph
and from novel to novel. Miss Delafield
is a valuable addition to the number of
writers, always small, whose books ornament
equally the drawing-room table and
the preference of undisturbed private
hours.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">“AS a matter of fact—although one hates to say such
a thing——” Lady Argent paused, in order to
give the thing its full conversational value. “As a
matter of absolute fact, those poor children are really to be
congratulated.”</p>

<p>“Because they are left orphans at five years old?”</p>

<p>“How you exaggerate, Ludovic! Rosamund is quite
fourteen, and the little one can’t be less than ten or eleven
years old. And she wasn’t much of a mother to them, poor
thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, what form did her modified motherhood take?”</p>

<p>“Ludovic, she <i>is</i> dead, after all,” Lady Argent reminded
her son. “But she was so much absorbed in her music, and
they didn’t get any proper education, as far as one knows.
And then, of course, during this last year she was quite
obviously dying—she ought really to have been in a sanatorium.”</p>

<p>“She must have been quite young,” said Ludovic Argent
reflectively.</p>

<p>“Only about seven- or eight-and-thirty. Don’t you remember
when she first settled here, just after the husband
died, and we were all so excited about this pretty young
widow and that enormous grand piano that had to be forced
in at the front-door with such difficulty?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I was at Oxford then, since I don’t remember
the sensation which the grand piano must indeed have
caused, if they got it through the front-door of that small
place.”</p>

<p>Ludovic Argent and his mother both gazed across the
valley below, because the front-door under discussion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
immediately opposite their own, although separated from it
by two slopes of hill and the River Wye. Only the window-panes
twinkling in the afternoon sun were visible.</p>

<p>“And what will happen to her grand piano now? I suppose
it will have to be got out again,” said Ludovic nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I was just telling you,” Lady Argent mistakenly
assured him. “In a way they really are to be
congratulated, poor little things. I believe Bertie Tregaskis
is going to look after them.”</p>

<p>“Is that the woman who pervades Cornwall with model
dairies and good works generally, and if so, what is she
doing in this <i>galère</i>?”</p>

<p>“She was a cousin of Mrs. Grantham’s, and the very day
after Mrs. Grantham became so much worse Bertie was
down here to see after those poor little girls. So exactly
like her, because it wasn’t a particularly near relationship
or anything—simply one of her magnificent, generous impulses.
They really have nobody, poor waifs; the mother
doesn’t seem to have had any belongings at all, or if she
had, they are Hungarians of sorts, and much better not
raked up, in all probability.”</p>

<p>“It is difficult to see who is available to do the raking,
certainly,” Ludovic admitted.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bertie would do anything that was <i>right</i>, of course,
but she’s simply solved the whole problem by saying she’ll
take them home with her. A woman who’s got more responsibilities
already than anyone I know—and a child of
her own besides—it really is rather magnificent of her,
Ludovic.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t they got any guardian or anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. That’s one of the things that shows
you what poor Mrs. Grantham was. Although she must
have known for at least a year that she was dying, she never
made any sort or kind of will. As a matter of fact I don’t
suppose she had anything to leave, and the father’s money
is safely secured for the two girls, Bertie says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“So Mrs. Tregaskis won’t have to take them for charity,
so to speak?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! I don’t think even she could do that, wonderful
manager though she is. She’s not at all well off. But
of course it’s everything for girls of that age—or of any
age, for that matter—to have a home. And she’ll be
such a mother to them! She always says she was meant to
be the mother of a large family and is wasted with just one
little girl.”</p>

<p>“So the children are to be congratulated,” remarked
Ludovic meditatively, as though summing up the situation.</p>

<p>“Well,” said his mother apologetically, “you know what
I mean. Poor Mrs. Grantham was so ill, and she really
was erratic—those long earrings, and all that music, and
she seemed altogether more Hungarian than English,
which was natural enough, I dare say, but not the best sort
of thing for the daughters of an English father. One
wouldn’t say anything unkind for the world—de mortuis—you
know what I mean, dear, though I can never recollect
the end of that proverb—or is it some sort of text?”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” Ludovic gravely assured her.</p>

<p>This untruth had been for many years his conversational
<i>cheval-de-bataille</i> in intercourse with his mother.</p>

<p>“You always do, darling,” she returned gratefully. “So
much more like a daughter than a son.”</p>

<p>She sighed, and Ludovic wondered if the sigh were a
tribute to the thought of her own non-existent daughter, or
to the infirmity which had kept her only son at home, to limp
his way through life in the Wye valley.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” his mother concluded as though presenting
a final solution, “Bertie is bringing the poor children here
this afternoon to say good-bye to me. It will be very good
for them to come out, and Bertie is so wonderfully broad-minded—there’s
no conventional nonsense about her. I do
want you to meet her, Ludovic.”</p>

<p>“Very well, mother dear. I’m rather curious, I’ve heard
so much about her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Towards five o’clock of that crisp October afternoon,
Ludovic Argent’s curiosity was gratified.</p>

<p>He limped into the library and found his mother in
earnest conversation with her friend.</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis was a woman of forty-five, and the
dominant impression produced upon Ludovic was one of
intense capability. Her strong black hair, untouched with
grey, sprang crisp and wiry from a capacious forehead, and
the broad contour of her strong face revealed innumerable
lines, hinting at the many activities indicated by Lady
Argent. Her white, rather prominent teeth were freely revealed
as she greeted Ludovic with the sane, ample smile
in which she seemed to envelop all her surroundings.</p>

<p>“This is a sad expedition of mine, but I’m very glad to
meet Sybil’s son at last; I’ve heard of you so often.”</p>

<p>Her voice was very much what he had expected from
her appearance—full, rather deep, and with a native decision
of utterance.</p>

<p>“And I of you, from my mother and—in Cornwall.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Cornwall!” She laughed outright. “I be Carnish
wumman, sure ’nuff.”</p>

<p>Her instant assumption of the Cornish burr, natural and
almost instinctive though it appeared to be, irritated
Ludovic.</p>

<p>With a quickness of perception which he was to learn was
characteristic of her, Mrs. Tregaskis appeared to perceive
it.</p>

<p>“I suspect you heard of me as ‘Miss Bertie,’ since I am
never allowed to be anything else down there. I do believe
that half Cornwall knew me as ‘Miss Bertie’ until I
married, and the name has stuck. At home, when I’m in
the village with Hazel, all the old women stand at their
doors and tell each other ‘’tis Miss Bertie and her l’il
maid.’”</p>

<p>“‘L’il maid’—how perfectly priceless,” murmured the
sympathetic Lady Argent, as in duty bound. Ludovic,
again conscious of unreasonable annoyance, found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
wondering captiously whether anyone ever spoke of anyone
else as a “l’il maid” outside the pages of a novel in dialect,
his pet aversion. The phrase seemed too probable to be
possible.</p>

<p>“Have you come from the Granthams’ place?” he demanded
abruptly, impelled by a vicious desire to abandon
the cloying topic of “Miss Bertie” and the atmosphere of
local adulation of which she seemed to him redolent.</p>

<p>Where else should she have come from? He was aware
that the question was ridiculous to the verge of politeness,
but she replied, with all her armour of cheery friendliness
unimpaired: “Yes, I’ve brought those two poor little girls,
but your mother very kindly let them go out and play in the
garden. So much better for them, after being shut up
these last few days. I shall be very glad to get them home
to-morrow; a change is the only thing.”</p>

<p>Her eyes, charged with kindly meanings, sought the
sympathetic response of Lady Argent’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Of course it is. And they are too young to feel any
wrench at leaving the place. It will probably be a relief to
get right away from the atmosphere—and then, of course,
they’ll love to be with your Hazel.”</p>

<p>“They’ve seen far too little of other children, and so, for
the matter of that, has Hazel,” declared Bertha Tregaskis
briskly. “I expect half a dozen rows royal to begin with,
but the prospect doesn’t daunt me, on the whole.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’ll cope with all and any of it,” returned
Lady Argent with a glance of fond admiration.</p>

<p>Ludovic felt sure of it too, but his sureness was untempered
by either fondness or admiration.</p>

<p>He felt a strong desire to be matter-of-fact, almost disagreeable
as far as possible, in this atmosphere of competent
kindness.</p>

<p>“I shall go and fetch them in to tea,” he announced,
reaching for his stick that was almost a crutch.</p>

<p>“Do, dear.”</p>

<p>As he went out at the French window Ludovic heard his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
mother murmuring wistfully: “He is so fond of children.”</p>

<p>He knew that she fostered this idea because she wished
him to marry. He told himself that, in point of fact,
he was not fond of children at all, and supposed that she
based her assertion on an isolated liking for the intelligent
small boy of an under-gardener.</p>

<p>Presently he saw the two children, in very modified
mourning, under a great ilex-tree at the bottom of the garden.
They were sitting on a bench side by side, very
quietly, but they both rose at the sound of his crutch on
the gravel.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said Ludovic gravely, and shook
hands with them both.</p>

<p>His first thought was that it was not fair to speak of
Rosamund Grantham, at all events, as a child, to bring her
out to tea, as though she were in need of childish diversion
to make her forget a childish sorrow, to send her to play in
the garden. He thought that perhaps she also had felt it so.
Resentment smouldered in her dark-ringed eyes, and in the
sulkily-cut lines of her very beautiful mouth.</p>

<p>There was much to recall the Slavonic type in her, in the
high moulding of the cheek-bones, the straight, rather
blunt nose, opaque ivory complexion, and straight black
brows. Her eyes, sombre and heavy-lidded, were of a
colour seldom seen in England—the true tint of clear deep
grey. Her build, however, showed no trace of a squat,
square-standing, Hungarian ancestry. She was very tall
for her thirteen years, but gave the impression of having
already almost attained to her full growth. Straight and
square-shouldered, she was far too thin for beauty, from
the defiant curve of neck and upheld chin to the long slim
fingers, betraying sensitiveness in every outstanding blue
vein and narrowed finger-tip.</p>

<p>Ludovic Argent, then and thereafter, thought that he had
never seen a creature more at odds with her world and
her passionate unbalanced self, than was Rosamund Grantham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Frances, her face at eleven years old already bearing the
impress of the dreamer in the steadfast gaze of eyes as
grey as those of her sister, gave a sense of reliance and purposefulness
that seemed to Ludovic amazing. Her small
face had a classical delicacy of outline, her mouth was
pathetically childish. Both had the same very soft brown
hair growing in a curious little point on the low square
forehead, and seeming too light in colour and texture for
the dark brows and lashes beneath.</p>

<p>Both greeted Ludovic with serious self-possession, but
Frances smiled at him a little, timidly, revealing teeth that
sloped inwards.</p>

<p>“My mother sent me to tell you that tea is ready. She
is in the library with Mrs. Tregaskis,” he said.</p>

<p>“Shall we come, then?” murmured Rosamund conventionally.
Her manner was that of a princess, and he surmised
that whatever the Hungarian past of Mrs. Grantham
might have concealed, a very secure assurance in
her own ineradicable birthright and breeding had descended
to her daughter.</p>

<p>“You have been here before, I know,” he said, as they
walked towards the house. “I expect I was at Oxford,
or abroad,” he added hastily, cursing himself for the
allusion which might recall expeditions with the dead
mother.</p>

<p>But Rosamund adjusted the trend of the conversation as
easily as she adjusted her pace to his halting steps.</p>

<p>“How nice to go abroad,” she said wistfully. “You
must know a lot of places. Have you been to Russia?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ludovic, and almost found himself asking,
“Have you?” as though to a contemporary.</p>

<p>“Neither have I, of course,” Rosamund assured him
rather apologetically, “but I am very much interested in it
just at present; I’ve been reading about Siberia.”</p>

<p>“What was the book?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only a children’s book—and I think it’s rather
old-fashioned—one about Siberian exiles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>A sudden memory of his boyhood, book-encompassed,
stirred eagerly in Ludovic.</p>

<p>“Is it called ‘The Young Exiles’?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Oh! have you read it too?”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and a delighted sense of recognition
seemed to dance in both.</p>

<p>“I like the beginning part of it best, when the father is
first arrested, and they go to the Czar. Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And have you come to the part....”</p>

<p>They were as much excited as old friends meeting unexpectedly
in a foreign country.</p>

<p>Ludovic remembered the book, which had absorbed him
twenty years earlier, a good deal more clearly than he
remembered the reviews which were now the objects of his
monthly perusal.</p>

<p>They talked about “The Young Exiles” until the house
was reached.</p>

<p>Lady Argent greeted them with smiles and kind, outstretched
hand, but Ludovic felt convinced by the rather
nervous cheeriness of her “Well, children dear, how do
you like the garden?” that Mrs. Tregaskis had been impressing
upon his mother the necessity for carrying off the
situation with a high-handed brightness.</p>

<p>The brightness of Mrs. Tregaskis herself was beyond
question.</p>

<p>“We heard you having a great pow-wow as you came
along,” she said gaily. “What was it all about?”</p>

<p>She looked at Rosamund, but it was Frances who, after
an instant’s pause, replied gently and gravely:</p>

<p>“It was about a book, mostly.”</p>

<p>“Ah! story-books, story-books, story-books!” Mrs.
Tregaskis shook her head good-humouredly. “I suspect
both these little people of being book-worms.”</p>

<p>The laugh in her kindly gaze was inflexible, and Lady
Argent responded to it by a faint tinkle of mirth that
Ludovic savagely told himself was sycophantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Well, I was a bit of a book-worm myself, once upon
a time. No, no, don’t ask me how long ago.” No one
showed any signs of doing so. “It must have been quite
a hundred years ago, since I wasn’t much bigger than
Frances is now, if you can imagine such a thing.”</p>

<p>She gave her ready, jolly laugh with both hands on her
wide hips.</p>

<p>“I used to sit up in an old pear-tree in the orchard
(down tü Tintagel ’twas, ma dear), and read everything I
could find—not the sort of story-books you children of to-day
get hold of, I can assure you, but books that you’d think
very stiff and dry, I expect.”</p>

<p>She was now addressing herself, almost in narrative
form, to Rosamund and Frances, but Ludovic noted with
venomous satisfaction that the politely unresponsive expression
on both faces seemed to discourage her slightly.</p>

<p>She turned to Lady Argent again, with another slight
laugh, as it were of proud apology for her own literary
infancy.</p>

<p>“I really believe I’d worked my way through the whole
of Motley’s ‘Dutch Republic’ before I was ten years old,
and as for Don Quixote, he was my hero. In fact my lightest
literature was Spenser’s ‘Faerie Queen,’ most of which
I knew by heart.”</p>

<p>“My dear! At ten years old! Just think of it!” This
from Lady Argent. Ludovic contented himself with the
bitter ejaculation:</p>

<p>“Liar!”</p>

<p>Which civil and ingratiating apostrophe was naturally
confined to his own breast.</p>

<p>“Don’t you find that this generation has a positively
vitiated taste as regards fiction?” Bertha Tregaskis demanded
of her hostess, who, having all her life been innocently
devoid of any taste for fiction at all, replied in an
unsure voice:</p>

<p>“Do you mean sort of penny dreadfuls, Bertie, dear?
which they always say the housemaids like, though I’m sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
mine have the most superior taste, for they read books
like ‘St. Elmo’ or ‘Donovan’ for choice, I believe. I
know my maid told me she was reading a novel called
‘Infelice,’ whatever that may mean. So educated of her, I
thought, to choose a book with a foreign name like that.”</p>

<p>“‘Infeleese’?” repeated Mrs. Tregaskis uncomprehendingly.
“Oh, <i>Infelice</i>! I know what you mean. My
dear Sybil!”</p>

<p>More laughter.</p>

<p>“Have I said something absurd?” Lady Argent helplessly
inquired; “I never do know anything about books,
you know—so unlike Ludovic.”</p>

<p>She looked proudly at her son.</p>

<p>“You know he writes, Bertie?”</p>

<p>Ludovic had writhed under this simple announcement
ever since his tenth year.</p>

<p>“But how splendid!” cried Mrs. Tregaskis with enthusiasm.
“Who publishes for you?”</p>

<p>Ludovic felt convinced that she expected him to disclaim
ever having got as far as publication, and took a vicious
satisfaction in replying:</p>

<p>“‘Cameron’s Review’ has taken one or two small things,
but they really are so very few and far between that only
a fond parent <i>could</i> look upon me as a writer, in any sense
of the word.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” murmured his mother. “Don’t listen to
him, Bertie. He had a most beautiful thing, pages and
pages long, all about Early English Poetry in the ‘Age of
Literature,’ only a few weeks ago.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis appeared to be as much impressed as the
fondest of parents could desire.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! Splendid! Scrumptious!” She
almost shouted in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I envy you dilettantes, who have time for all that sort of
thing. A poverty-stricken Cornish woman like myself has
to write what and when she can, just to turn an honest
penny now and then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Bertie! you don’t mean to say you write, as <i>well</i> as
everything else?”</p>

<p>“Oh my dear Sybil, the greatest rubbish, you know—just
a story here and there, to bring in a much-needed
guinea.”</p>

<p>She laughed the gallant laugh of one who would scorn
to deny the need of guineas.</p>

<p>“How <i>too</i> wonderful she is,” said Lady Argent in an undertone
to the universe at large. “Bertie, you must let us
read your stories.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, my dear. They’re only just scribbled off between
a Mothers’ Meeting and a dairy class—just anyhow.
What would the writer say to that?”</p>

<p>She looked roguishly at Ludovic.</p>

<p>“How I envy you! If I had nothing else to do but sit
in this magnificent study, I should try and write a book,
perhaps; but as it is ... I envy you.”</p>

<p>There was an instant’s silence.</p>

<p>An unpardonable instinct to see whether it were possible
thoroughly to disconcert his mother’s friend seized upon
Ludovic.</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness,” he said slowly, and with an entirely
assumed bitterness of tone, “that I <i>had</i> something
to do besides sit in a study and scribble—it’s not fit for a
man.”</p>

<p>It was almost the first time that his mother had ever heard
him allude to his infirmity, and she flushed from brow to
chin.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Tregaskis was more than equal to the situation,
as its creator had surmised that she would be.</p>

<p>The jovial lines of her face softened into kindly compassion,
and the slow noddings of her head were portentous
with understanding:</p>

<p>“Aha!” she murmured eloquently, and the depths of comprehension
in her brooding gaze left Ludovic utterly defeated.
Then, after a moment’s silence, obviously consecrated
by Mrs. Tregaskis to her complete and all-embracing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
understanding of Ludovic Argent, she gravitated skilfully
towards a brighter outlook.</p>

<p>“What a joy that little gift of writing is, though! I
always say it’s like the quality of mercy, twice blessed—it
blesses him that gives <i>and</i> him that takes——”</p>

<p>“My dear Bertie!” said Lady Argent with her soft laugh,
and under a vague impression that Bertie was being epigrammatic
and slightly daring with a passage from the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very true,” laughed Mrs. Tregaskis. “I’m
sure the readers of ‘Cameron’s’ and the ‘Age of Literature’
often bless your son’s contributions, and as to ‘him
that gives,’ I know it really is the greatest joy to me sometimes,
when the real work of the day is done, to feel I can
let myself sit down for a few minutes and turn out half a
dozen little French couplets or some fanciful piece of nonsense
about children and fairies—you know the sort of
thing. It does seem to rest one so.”</p>

<p>“To rest one!” echoed Lady Argent, with at least three
notes of admiration in her voice.</p>

<p>“Children, do you realize what a wonderful person your—your
guardian is? She’ll tell you all sorts of stories
about fairies and things. I know you’re perfectly marvellous
with children, Bertie,” she added in a most audible
aside.</p>

<p>“Little people generally like my long yarns about the
Cornish pixies,” admitted Mrs. Tregaskis. “Have you ever
seen a pixie, Frances?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frances coldly.</p>

<p>“Ah, they don’t grow in this part of the world. But
there are wonderful things in Cornwall, as you’ll find out
when you live there.”</p>

<p>“When do you go?” asked Ludovic of Rosamund.</p>

<p>Her sensitive face flushed.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, I think,” she half-whispered, with a glance
in the direction of Mrs. Tregaskis, that seemed to Ludovic
to convey hostility and a half defiant fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Well, Sybil,” Bertha observed, “am I to see the garden,
too?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course. I’m longing for your advice—you
know so much about a garden, and those things you made
me get for the rockery last year aren’t doing quite as well
as I hoped. Do come and tell me what you think of them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis rose. Her eye rested for a moment on
the children. Then she said briskly:</p>

<p>“The children must show us the way. I expect they’ve
ferreted out every corner in the place, during that grand
exploration before tea, if they haven’t actually danced upon
your most cherished rock-plants. I know what country kids
are like.”</p>

<p>Ludovic thought of the two little forlorn figures that he
had found under the great ilex-tree, and Mrs. Tregaskis’
joviality seemed to him singularly out of place.</p>

<p>He rose and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Form fours—quick march—left, right, left, right,”
cried Bertie playfully, giving Rosamund a gentle push by
the shoulders.</p>

<p>Rosamund and Frances went out.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. TREGASKIS shut the door behind them with
astonishing briskness and whisked round to face
her hostess.</p>

<p>“A little diplomatic ruse, my dear, to get those infants
out of hearing. And once out of doors they’ll be tearing all
over the place and forget our very existence. I really
must talk to you about them—that eldest girl means trouble
if <i>I</i> know anything of spoilt children. I foresee a scene this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Why, Bertie dear? I thought them so very brave and
good, poor little things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what children are! They’ve practically
‘got over’ it as people say, already, but there’s bound to be
an outburst, I’m afraid, at the ‘last evening’—you know
the kind of thing. The men have been taking away the furniture,
such of it as is going to be sold, this afternoon while
we’ve been out, and I do rather dread taking them back to
that half-dismantled cottage. Rosamund is very highly
strung, poor child, and she always infects the little one.”</p>

<p>“Poor children,” sighed Lady Argent, while Ludovic was
wishing that Mrs. Tregaskis had not taken up a position that
rendered it impossible for him to walk out at the door.</p>

<p>“Poor me, too, I think. It’s very stupid to mind it, but
these days have been a frightful strain, in a way—one has
somehow felt for them so much more than they’ve probably
felt for themselves. But what with mothering them, and
seeing to the business part of it all, and packing up, I really
feel a rag.”</p>

<p>She sank limply into an armchair and Ludovic made for
the unguarded doorway as rapidly as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“My poor dear! But why shouldn’t you all stay here for
the night, and avoid going back to the cottage at all. <i>Do</i> do
that, Bertie dear.”</p>

<p>“Sybil, you angel!” cried Mrs. Tregaskis, reviving
abruptly. “What a lot it would save me—I’ve simply
been dreading to-night. But wouldn’t it be a fearful
nuisance?”</p>

<p>Ludovic opened the door, stumbled on the threshold, then
awkwardly readjusted his crutch and shut the library door
with a hasty bang.</p>

<p>He had almost fallen over Rosamund Grantham, crouching
outside the door.</p>

<p>She raised a deeply flushed face, and he looked gravely
down at her. He was shocked only at the unchildlike
misery and exhaustion that showed in her dark-circled eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me help you up from the floor,” he said after a
moment, as though her position were the most usual one
for a guest to select.</p>

<p>She let him take her hand and raise her from the floor,
and then followed him slowly across the hall into a small
morning-room.</p>

<p>Ludovic supposed that he ought to say: “Listening at
doors is dishonourable,” but the sense of courtesy, apparently
less in abeyance than where Bertha Tregaskis was
concerned, revolted, and he moreover felt convinced that
Rosamund was as well aware as himself of the breach she
had committed.</p>

<p>Presently she said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“I know it is dreadful to listen at doors. I have never
done it before, but I felt certain—<i>certain</i>—that they
would try and arrange something or other without telling
me—perhaps separate me and Francie or something;
there’s nobody to understand anything, and I don’t know
what is going to happen to us.”</p>

<p>“They can’t separate you and your sister,” said Ludovic
earnestly; “no one could do that.”</p>

<p>“Then what are they settling in there, all by themselves?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
I know they’re talking about us, because I could hear a little—but
only a very little—that was the worst of it.”</p>

<p>She began to struggle with tears.</p>

<p>“My mother asked Mrs. Tregaskis to stay here with
you and your sister, for to-night, instead of going back,”
he told her straight.</p>

<p>“Why weren’t Frances and I asked if we would? Why
is it arranged like that without telling me?” she demanded
resentfully, her voice shaking.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose Mrs. Tregaskis thought you
would not mind. Do you mind very much? If you do, I—I
will see that you <i>do</i> go home to-night,” said Ludovic
desperately.</p>

<p>She looked at him for an instant with a sort of wonder
in her eyes that touched him acutely, and then broke into
floods of tears.</p>

<p>Ludovic stood looking out of the window.</p>

<p>“She is utterly bewildered by that woman,” he told himself
angrily, “and distrusts her instinctively. Heaven help
the child! What will she do in Cornwall? That woman
will break her. Dear, kind, wonderful Bertie, as my mother
calls her! and those two—sensitive, highly-strung, who’ve
probably lived in an atmosphere of understanding all their
lives....”</p>

<p>He wondered for a wild instant if his mother could be
persuaded to receive Rosamund and Frances as daughters.
It hardly seemed probable, in view alone of her admiration
for their self-appointed guardian. How could the
charges of the benevolent cousin be reft from her under no
pretext but their reluctance to be benefited, and Ludovic
Argent’s passionate conviction that such beneficence would
be the ruin of both?</p>

<p>“I’m not crying any more,” said Rosamund’s voice behind
him, after a few moments.</p>

<p>He turned round.</p>

<p>“What shall I do? Shall I tell my mother that you are
to go to your home again this evening?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, thank you. In a way, they’re quite right.
Frances would only cry, which would be bad for her.”</p>

<p>“Where is she now?” asked Ludovic.</p>

<p>“In the garden. She doesn’t know,” said Rosamund,
colouring again, “about my listening at the door. She
would think it dreadful, and I know it is—but somehow
nothing seemed to matter except just to know what was
going to be done with us.”</p>

<p>She looked mournfully at him and he saw her, bewildered
and defenceless, thrust among alien standards
and with all the foundations of her tiny world rocking.
No wonder that in a suddenly revolutionized scale of values
honour had seemed to count for less than the primitive
instinct of self-defence.</p>

<p>“What <i>can</i> I do for you?” he said, almost unconsciously
venting aloud the strong sense of impotent compassion that
moved him.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, “nobody can make things come right
again—even God couldn’t, though I’ve prayed and prayed.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean—your mother?”</p>

<p>“My mother <i>had</i> to die,” she told him seriously. “She
coughed and coughed every night, sometimes right on till
the next morning. The night that she died, it was dreadful.
She never stopped. I prayed for anything that might
stop her coughing like that, and God answered the prayer
by making her die. When I heard she wasn’t coughing any
more, I thought it was all my prayers being answered, and
I went to sleep, and then in the morning <i>she</i> came and told
us that mother had died.”</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at him, with the most pathetic
look that can be seen on a child’s face, that of bewilderment
at pain.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Ludovic in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie said we could go in and see her afterwards,
but I wouldn’t”—she shuddered—“I thought it
would frighten Francie so. And we didn’t go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
funeral, either. Were you there?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“No. I only came back from Paris yesterday,” he told
her gently.</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie went. She was very kind, and made us
go in the garden, and told us a lot of things about heaven,
and mother being quite well again now and happy, and
somehow it didn’t all seem so bad then. But now we’re
going away, and—and there’s nobody to understand. Except
you,” she added mournfully.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any relations at all?”</p>

<p>“No. Only Cousin Bertie. She is very kind, and she
is taking us to live with her—but oh, she doesn’t understand!”</p>

<p>The despair in Rosamund’s voice seemed to Ludovic
Argent to sum up all the inadequacy that he had felt in
Bertha Tregaskis. She was very kind—she was taking
the orphans to live with her—but she would never “understand.”</p>

<p>He felt her lack of understanding to be yet more apparent
when Mrs. Tregaskis called Rosamund and Frances
back to the library, just as Frances timidly pushed open the
French window of the room where he stood with Rosamund.</p>

<p>An imploring look from Rosamund made him follow
them quickly into the library.</p>

<p>Lady Argent welcomed him with a glad look in which,
nevertheless, he detected a slight surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, you two,” began Bertha in a tone of careful
gaiety, “what do you think of an invitation? Kind Lady
Argent wants us all three to stay here for the night. Then
cook won’t have any trouble about getting supper ready for
us, and we shan’t have to bother any more about squeezing
into the bedrooms with all those trunks! Isn’t that splendid?”</p>

<p>“We shall have to go back to get our things,” said Frances
quickly and solemnly.</p>

<p>“I’ll see to all that,” declared kind Mrs. Tregaskis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
briskly. “I’m going to pop over and see to one or two
things, and I’ll bring back the nighties with me. I shall put
on my seven-leagued boots, and be back before you know
I’ve gone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go back with you,” said Rosamund.</p>

<p>“No, my dear. It’s too far for you.” There was an
underlying anxiety in Mrs. Tregaskis’ firm kindliness.</p>

<p>Frances looked at her sister with consternation.</p>

<p>“But—but——” she half-whispered, turning her back
on Mrs. Tregaskis, “it’s our very last night at home. We
<i>must</i> go back, Rosamund.”</p>

<p>“Bon! ça y est,” ejaculated Bertie under her breath and
casting a glance of humorous despair at Lady Argent and
Ludovic. “Une scène de première classe!”</p>

<p>He noted with angry resentment her admirable French.</p>

<p>“Rosamund and Frances,” she said, in a tone of elaborate
reasonableness, “I want you to listen to me, like good children.
Lady Argent is very kindly letting you stay here so
that we shouldn’t have to go back to the cottage, which is
all upside down with packing and—and furniture and
things, and I want you to be very good and give no trouble
at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” breathed Lady Argent, distressed. “But
would they rather—do they want to go to the cottage
again——” She hesitated helplessly.</p>

<p>“Bless me,” cried Bertie cheerily, “the cottage isn’t going
to run away in the night. There’ll be heaps of time to-morrow
morning before we start for home.”</p>

<p>Rosamund flushed an angry red.</p>

<p>“The cottage is <i>our</i> home,” she said with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, that’s very loyal of you,” laughed her
guardian, “and I’m quite ready to hear you call it so until
you’ve got used to our part of the world.</p>

<p>“Now what about washing paws, Sybil, before we adorn
your dinner-table?”</p>

<p>It was perhaps this masterly conduct of a difficult situation
that made Lady Argent say to her son that evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
when Mrs. Tregaskis had hurried upstairs “just to give
those two a tucking-up and ‘God bless you’”:</p>

<p>“Oh Ludovic! How splendid Bertie is, and how I hope
it will turn out well.”</p>

<p>“Why should it not?” asked Ludovic, who held, indeed,
his own certainties as to why it should not, but was perversely
desirous of hearing and contradicting his mother’s
point of view.</p>

<p>“It’s always rather a risk, isn’t it, to take other people’s
children like that, even though they are relations. But
they’re dear little girls, and so good and brave.”</p>

<p>“They seem to me singularly intelligent, and altogether
rather remarkable.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, one does feel that,” returned Lady Argent
with the sort of gentle cordiality with which she almost always
acclaimed any opportunity of praising others, and
which consequently detracted considerably from the value
of her approbation. “They are not at all ordinary, I feel
sure, and that’s why it seems so very fortunate that Bertie,
of all people, should take them. She will <i>understand</i> them
so wonderfully. Her love of children is one of the most
characteristic things about her, and she always says herself
that she’s never quite stopped being a child in some
ways, and so understands children. They come to her
instinctively. Children and animals always <i>know</i>, they
say.”</p>

<p>Ludovic had met this aphorism before, and disagreed
with it profoundly, but he had no wish to deprive his mother
of any of the gentle Victorian beliefs which ruled her
life. At thirty years old, Ludovic Argent was still young
enough to feel superior.</p>

<p>But at this moment his thoughts were altogether engaged
with the little girls who yesterday had been all but unknown
to him. Presently, to his own surprise, he said:</p>

<p>“Mother, you wouldn’t consider the idea of having those
two here, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean for good, Ludovic?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>He did, but a certain strain of moral cowardice, always
latent in the imaginative, made him temporize.</p>

<p>“Well—for a long visit, perhaps. I—I think they’d
be happier near their old home, and in their own part of
the world.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear boy,” said his astonished mother, “you
surely don’t mean to suggest that I should adopt two children
of whom I know hardly anything, when they’ve already
been offered an excellent and much more suitable home with
a relation? It would be quite impossible. Do think of
what you’re saying.”</p>

<p>Ludovic thought. From every point of view his suggestion
was inadmissible. The instinct which had prompted
it, he decided, was unpractical sentimentality.</p>

<p>He rose abruptly.</p>

<p>“You’re right, of course. It would be quite impossible.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent’s sigh was compounded of mingled relief
and regret that any scheme suggested by her son would
prove to be impracticable.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said, by way of compromise, “we could
have them to stay, later on. I quite see what you mean
about their liking the Wye valley, poor little things. And
of course I know how fond you are of children, darling.”</p>

<p>Ludovic rightly conjectured that the last few hours had
for ever placed this parental illusion beyond the reach of
doubt. It would be part of the penalty of an unconventional,
and therefore unpractical, suggestion.</p>

<p>“The infants are asleep!” cried Bertha Tregaskis at the
door, merrily, triumphantly, and also, as it happened, altogether
untruly. “At least if they’re not they ought to be.
I left them very much <i>en route</i> for the Land of Nod, though
Rosamund wouldn’t own to it, and of course the little one
always holds fast by her. I tell you what, Sybil, it will be
the making of them both to be with another child. As it is,
I can see that Rosamund is domineering, and Frances simply
has no individuality of her own. It always is so when
there are only two. The elder or cleverer or stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
simply has things all her own way—and Rosamund is all
three. She has any amount of character, but I foresee a
handful. Well, it’s all in the day’s work, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“As though your day wasn’t full enough already, Bertie
dear!”</p>

<p>Ludovic left the room.</p>

<p>Next morning the visitors were driven early to the station.
There was, after all, Mrs. Tregaskis had declared at
breakfast, no time to return to the cottage on the other side
of the valley—Rosamund and Frances must wave to it
from the train window. Couldn’t they see the garden and
a little bit of the house from the train? Very well, then it
would be quite exciting to watch for it. They could have a
race to see who caught sight of it first.</p>

<p>Into this bracing atmosphere of cheery optimism Ludovic’s
voice cut coldly and decisively:</p>

<p>“I can drive round that way, if you wish it.” He addressed
himself directly to Rosamund. His mother looked
surprised, but it was left to Bertha to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Only at the risk of missing the train, and I don’t want
to do that—my old man is counting on my being back by
the early train, and he’ll drive down to meet it, I expect.
That’s no joke, when one lives three miles from the station
at the top of one of our Cornish hills!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis was always possessive when speaking of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you might find it rather out of your way,
Ludovic, and we haven’t left much time,” began Lady
Argent apologetically.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Rosamund miserably, answering
Ludovic’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Good girl!” said Mrs. Tregaskis approvingly. “Why,
Francie!”</p>

<p>Frances had suddenly begun to cry, quietly and hopelessly.</p>

<p>Rosamund said “<i>Francie!</i>” in a tone of exasperated
misery that spoke of nerves rasped to breaking point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Hush! Leave her to me,” commanded her guardian.
“Frances, darling, what is it? Come here to me. What
is the matter?”</p>

<p>She held out both her capable hands.</p>

<p>Frances looked at her quite silently with streaming eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Lady Argent pitifully, and Frances turned
to her at once and hid her face against the outstretched arm.</p>

<p>“Poor little thing,” said Lady Argent almost tearfully.
But Ludovic noted that his mother seemed to comfort
Frances in an instinctive sort of way, with gentle hand
stroking her hair, and without attempting to make her
speak.</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis, “wonderful with children,” Ludovic
ironically reflected, was capable of nothing more startling
than an imperative:</p>

<p>“Hush, now, Rosamund. She’ll stop in a minute. Go
on with your breakfast, and remember that you have a long
journey in front of you. However, you’ll have a real Cornish
tea when you arrive—splits and cream, and pasties,
and all sorts of things. Us has a real proper ole set-tü, at
tay-time.” She laughed, and for the rest of the meal was
very jovial and talkative, drawing attention from Frances,
who presently stopped crying and wiped her eyes in a
shamefaced way. She looked timidly once or twice at
Rosamund, which glances were intercepted by Mrs. Tregaskis
with significantly raised eyebrows which said plainly
to Lady Argent, “What did I tell you?”</p>

<p>But it was Ludovic who saw the elder sister’s answering
look and read into it her intense agony of protective love
and impotent apprehension. The dead mother might have
made Frances’ world, but Frances made Rosamund’s.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“HERE we are!” declared Mrs. Tregaskis thankfully,
as the train slowed down at Porthlew. “I
declare it’s good to be alive, in such weather and
a country like this one.”</p>

<p>She descended lightly on to the astonishingly bleak little
platform, empty and swept by a north wind.</p>

<p>“Now for bags and baggage! Frances—umbrellas,
dressing-bag, papers—that’s all right. Rosamund? Come
along, darlings, you must get out everything while I see to
the luggage. Porter! Ah, Trewin, good-afternoon. Is
the trap outside? Just show these young ladies the way,
and then come back for the trunks. How’s the wife?”</p>

<p>“Better, thank you, Mrs. Tregaskis,” said the man, touching
his cap with a grin.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Tell her I’ll be round to see her in a
day or two.”</p>

<p>Kind, competent Mrs. Tregaskis hurried along, beaming
and exchanging greetings with one or two porters and a
newspaper-boy.</p>

<p>“How pleased they all are to see her,” said Frances
wistfully. “Isn’t it cold, Rosamund?”</p>

<p>“It’s much colder than at home. Turn up your collar,
Francie. Do you think we shall go to the house in a cab?”</p>

<p>“No—she said the old man would drive down in a trap.
I suppose it’s the coachman.”</p>

<p>“I think she meant Cousin Frederick. She said ‘<i>my</i> old
man.’”</p>

<p>“Oh! Is he very old?” asked Frances in rather awe-struck
tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I suppose he must be.”</p>

<p>But when they presently went outside the station and
climbed into the tall dog-cart, driven by Cousin Frederick,
they did not think him very old after all.</p>

<p>He was small and brown and clean-shaven, with a thin,
deeply lined face and a curious twist at the corner of his
mouth that gave him the appearance of always wearing
a rather sardonic smile. But his little grey eyes were inscrutable,
and never smiled. No one had ever called him
Freddy, or even Fred.</p>

<p>He lifted his cap to Rosamund and Frances and said:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t get down. The mare won’t stand.
Do you mind sitting at the back?”</p>

<p>They climbed up obediently, and from an elevation which
both secretly felt to be perilous, watched the arrival of
Mrs. Tregaskis and sundry minor articles of luggage.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” she announced gaily to her husband,
after the universal but obvious fashion of the newly arrived.
“How are you, dear? and how’s Hazel? All well
at home? That’s right, thank you, Trewin. You’ll see to
the boxes, won’t you. I suppose the luggage cart is here?”</p>

<p>Frederick pointed silently with the whip.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, that’s all right. Well, I’ll pop in, and we can
be off.”</p>

<p>She patted the mare vehemently.</p>

<p>“Jenny needs clipping,” she observed in parenthesis.
“Well”—she got in beside her husband.</p>

<p>As they drove through the steep town of Porthlew Mrs.
Tregaskis exchanged cheery salutations in her hearty, ringing
voice with a number of people. Frederick slanted the
whip slightly in the direction of his cap, straightened it
again, and said nothing.</p>

<p>Neither did he say anything throughout the three-mile
drive, nor when they stopped before the square stone house,
and Mrs. Tregaskis kissed first Rosamund and then Frances,
on the steps of the porch, and said:</p>

<p>“Welcome home, darlings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Then she shouted aloud:</p>

<p>“Hazel, my poppet! Hazel! Come and say how d’ye
do to the cousins.”</p>

<p>Hazel Tregaskis, aged fourteen, came into the hall. She
was small and brown like her father, with something of the
same twist at the corner of her mouth, but rendered charming
by rippling tawny hair, and beautiful eyes where an
elfin spirit of mockery seemed eternally to dance. She
held herself very erect, and moved with remarkable grace
and lightness.</p>

<p>They had tea in the hall, and Hazel sat beside her father
and chattered freely to the new arrivals.</p>

<p>“Where is Minnie?” suddenly demanded Mrs. Tregaskis.
“Frederick, we’ve forgotten Minnie. Where is
Minnie? Hazel, where is Minnie—where is Miss Blandflower,
darling?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Hazel calmly.</p>

<p>“Go and find her at once, my pet. Poor Miss Blandflower!
You know this isn’t quite like her own home, and
we never want to let her feel herself forgotten, or unwanted.
Now run, Hazel.”</p>

<p>Hazel rose from her place with no appearance of haste,
and went slowly in search of the missing one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis remarked rather elaborately:</p>

<p>“Miss Blandflower is a very old friend of ours, though
she is a great deal younger than I am. She will give you
your lessons, I hope, with Hazel.”</p>

<p>“Is she Hazel’s governess?” inquired Frances gently.</p>

<p>Frederick Tregaskis nodded, but his wife said with an air
of slight repression: “She lives with us, Frances dear, as
I told you, and we do our very best to make her feel that
this is her home. You see, Miss Blandflower is extremely
poor, and has nowhere else to live.”</p>

<p>“Like us,” returned Frances with mournful matter-of-factness.</p>

<p>“Not at all like you,” said her cousin Frederick, suddenly
looking at her. “Neither you nor Rosamund need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
think that you have nowhere to go. You will have money
of your father’s some day, in fact it belongs to you now,
and will be used for your education and any other expenses.
You can go to school, if you would like that, or
live with anybody——”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Frederick, we needn’t go into these sordid
details,” said Bertha, with an extremely annoyed laugh.</p>

<p>Frances looked bewildered, as though she felt herself to
have received a rebuke, but Rosamund’s grey eyes met those
of Frederick Tregaskis with a sudden lightening of their
sombre gloom.</p>

<p>“I disagree with you, Bertha,” he observed, with a look
of dislike at his wife. “These things are much better
clearly defined. It is quite conceivable that Rosamund and
Frances may dislike the position of refugees under our
hospitable roof, and in that case they may as well know that
I shall further any reasonable scheme they may entertain
for existence elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Frederick, how impossible you are, dear. The children
will think you don’t want them. Cousin Frederick is only
joking, darling,” she added, laying her hand on Frances’
reassuringly.</p>

<p>“I never joke,” said Cousin Frederick with an acid expression
that did much to confirm his statement. “Another
cup of tea, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Here is Minnie,” cried Mrs. Tregaskis in tones of
relief not wholly attributable to the appearance of Miss
Blandflower.</p>

<p>“Here I am, last but not least,” agitatedly murmured the
late-comer, while her hostess cordially embraced her, and
presented Rosamund and Frances.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower belonged to that numerous and mistaken
class of person which supposes the art of witty conversation
to lie in the frequent quotation of well-known tags
and the humorously-intended mispronunciation of the more
ordinary words in the English language.</p>

<p>She said, “Not lost, but gone before,” with a slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
nervous laugh, when Bertha deplored her lateness for tea,
and explained that this was due to a mistaken impression
that tea was to be at five o’clock. However, live and learn.
And it was almost mechanically that she murmured, on
being invited to eat saffron cake: “Once more unto the
breach, dear friends, once more, well, perhaps I will——”</p>

<p>“Minnie,” said Mrs. Tregaskis, shaking a playfully admonishing
finger at her, “how, now <i>how</i>, is the dairy?
Have you been in once since I’ve been away?”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Tregaskis, how can you? Of course I have.
I’ve tried to see to everything, though of course no one
could take your place. I needn’t tell you that.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish, my dear, rubbish. How’s the new dairy-maid?
I was very vexed at having to leave without settling
her, I must confess. Will she do?”</p>

<p>“‘I doubt it, said the carpenter,’” returned Minnie,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>Her voice never gave any hint of inverted commas, and
Frances looked at her with large, surprised eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower was thin and sandy, with eyeglasses,
and might have been of any age between thirty-four and
forty. She several times glanced affectionately at Mrs.
Tregaskis, and said, “A sight for sore eyes, as they say,”
and then flung a nervous look at Frederick, who remained
silent.</p>

<p>After tea Rosamund and Frances were shown the garden,
where Cousin Bertha had turned a piece of rough ground
into a tennis court, and made a herbaceous border and two
rockeries, and the stables, where Cousin Bertha proposed
personally to conduct the clipping of the mare Jenny, on the
morrow, and where she slapped Jenny’s hind-quarters with
a heartiness that violently disconcerted both children, unused
to animals of any description.</p>

<p>They were also taken over the little dairy, where Cousin
Bertha superintended the making of cheese and butter and
cream which, she assured them, to their utter bewilderment,
“paid,” and where she also weekly instructed a class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of girls from the neighbouring farms. They were shown
the chickens, bred and kept and fed, and, Frances supposed
in her utter ignorance of the expert language employed by
her cousin, doubtless hatched by Cousin Bertha, and the
little orchard where Cousin Bertha had planted a variety of
small apple-trees, most of which she indicated by name.</p>

<p>Hazel came with them, and gazed compassionately at the
obviously bewildered pair.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got a dairy and chickens and a horse at
your home?” she asked Rosamund, who replied darkly:</p>

<p>“No. We don’t understand about those sort of things.
We had books and a garden, and two cats with kittens,
at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>this</i> home will give you something new!” declared
her guardian with undiminished brightness, although
Rosamund’s tone had been far indeed from expressing enthusiasm
for “those sort of things.”</p>

<p>“We had a most beautiful piano,” said Frances to Hazel.
“It was so good that it was called the Grand Piano, and
nobody ever touched it except——”</p>

<p>She stopped and coloured.</p>

<p>Hazel nodded her head quickly.</p>

<p>“Except your mummy, I expect,” she said calmly, and
gave Frances’ hand a little squeeze.</p>

<p>Rosamund heard and saw her, and from thence onward
she liked Hazel Tregaskis.</p>

<p>Cousin Bertha said:</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got a piano here, and you shall hear it
presently. I expect you’re fond of music, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>There was a silence before Frances timidly replied
“Yes,” as in duty bound. She liked tunes very much herself,
and she knew that Rosamund never would talk about
music, and that mother had said she had no ear. But
Cousin Bertha evidently expected “yes” for an answer,
and Frances unconsciously felt that Cousin Bertha was one
of those persons who would always receive just exactly
that answer which they expect to receive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>When it grew dark they went indoors, and into the
drawing-room. There was some furniture, which Cousin
Bertha, who knew a great deal about furniture, said was
old and very good, and an upright piano.</p>

<p>“Would you like me to play to you?” said Cousin
Bertha. “Hazel always comes to the drawing-room for an
hour before she has her supper, and we enjoy ourselves.
There’ll be lots more games we can play now you two have
come. But I dare say you’d rather just have a little music,
to-night.”</p>

<p>Rosamund, the unmusical, shook her head dumbly and
almost imperceptibly. But Frances, still with that hypnotic
sense of having to reply whatever Cousin Bertha expected
her to reply, said: “Yes, if you please.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Tregaskis sat down at the piano and played
without any music in front of her, some very gay and
spirited tunes, and sometimes she sang in a strong, ringing
voice, and called to Hazel to join in the chorus.</p>

<p>Rosamund and Frances sat in the shadow and held one
another’s hands.</p>

<p>Presently Hazel joined them and said very low indeed:</p>

<p>“Do you like it?”</p>

<p>“It is very kind of Cousin Bertha,” gravely returned
Rosamund.</p>

<p>“I don’t much like it when mother plays. I would rather
play myself,” said Hazel. “There’s a person at Porthlew
called Mrs. Severing who plays beautifully. She has published
a lot of music—songs and things.”</p>

<p>“Shall we ever see her?” asked Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, she often comes here. She is mother’s greatest
friend. We’ll make her play really nice things.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like Cousin Bertha’s things that she plays?
I do,” said Frances, rather shocked.</p>

<p>“Rosamund doesn’t,” shrewdly returned Hazel. But
Rosamund remained silent, partly from courtesy, and partly
because she knew that she would not be able to keep the
tumult of misery that was choking her out of her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>The memory of Wye Valley days, already remote, was
gripping her unendurably. Her emotions, infinitely
stronger than her undeveloped personality, were always
strung to breaking pitch at the appeal made to them by
music. For although it was true that she had very little
ear, and that her fingers were devoid of all skill, the Slavonic
tradition and the Slavonic passion were in her blood,
and to such as these, music is a doorway better left secure.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Tregaskis had reiterated several times in
rousing tones that here was a health unto His Majesty, with
a Fal-lal-lal-lal lah la, Hazel said:</p>

<p>“Please, will you play the one I like out of that book?”</p>

<p>“I thought you liked them all,” her parent replied, not
without a hint of amused resentment. “Which do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“King Charles.”</p>

<p>“Oh! ‘Farewell Manchester.’ Very well, darling, and
then you must pop off upstairs.”</p>

<p>The song she played was much slower and quieter than
the others, and she did not sing it. Neither Rosamund nor
Frances had ever heard it before, but the infinite sadness
of the simple melody made its instant appeal to a sensitiveness
which was singularly developed in both.</p>

<p>Frances cried a little quite silently with her face pressed
against her sister’s arm, and Rosamund clenched her hands
together and set her teeth.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Tregaskis closed the piano and came towards
them, Rosamund said: “Thank you very much, Cousin
Bertha.”</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she had been saying just that,
again and again, for days.</p>

<p>“Call me ‘Cousin Bertie,’ darling. I declare I shall fine
the next person who says that dreadful ‘Cousin Bertha.’
Such a prim, horrid name, I always think. Besides, I only
know myself as Bertie. Do you know the people down here
still call me Miss Bertie. Don’t they, Hazel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Rosamund did know. She had heard Mrs. Tregaskis say
so already.</p>

<p>She went drearily up to the schoolroom supper, where
Miss Blandflower was waiting for them.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ve brought good appetites with you from
Wales,” she said, taking her place at the head of the table.
“I see I must ‘<i>wrastle</i>’ with this large ham-bone.”</p>

<p>She did so, in the ineffectual manner that was characteristic
of her.</p>

<p>“Shall I cut the bread, Miss Blandflower?” asked Hazel.</p>

<p>“Please, dear, if you will do,” replied her teacher of
English.</p>

<p>The meal was a silent one.</p>

<p>Little Frances was fighting bravely with tears and fatigue,
and Rosamund’s thoughts were in the Wye Valley, where
lights were beginning to tremble in the cottage windows,
and only the little house on the slope of the hill would remain
dark and silent. Hazel looked at them from time to
time with a sort of compassion in her great laughing eyes,
but was more engaged in a kind of silent drama conducted
between her knife and her silver mug, with which she
nightly diversified the monotony of meals eaten in Miss
Blandflower’s company.</p>

<p>When presently she upset the mug half-full of milk, Minnie
rose, rebuked her pupil querulously, murmured something
which sounded like “Well, Allah gear cum allah gear,
as they say,” applied her table-napkin to the widening pool,
and the meal came to an end.</p>

<p>Interminable though the day had seemed, it was finished
at last, and Rosamund and Frances were lying in the pretty bedroom
which they were to share.</p>

<p>“I think Hazel is going to be nice,” whispered Frances
wistfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, so do I. But I wish we had stayed with Lady
Argent and the son who was lame.”</p>

<p>“Oh! so do I!”</p>

<p>“Nearly asleep, my darlings?” inquired Cousin Bertha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
at the door. “I’ve just run up to say good-night. I always
tuck Hazel up, and now I must do the same to my
two new little daughters.”</p>

<p>“Rosamund,” said Frances in a guilty whisper, when
Mrs. Tregaskis had rustled softly away again, “perhaps we
oughtn’t to have wished that, about having stayed with
Lady Argent. Cousin Bertie is very, very kind, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>If an unconscious appeal for reassurance underlay the
question, neither Frances nor Rosamund was aware of it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Rosamund, with shamed conviction;
“she is very, very kind.”</p>

<p>Kind Mrs. Tregaskis was already hastening downstairs
again. In the lamp-lit library her husband was reading the
newspaper. He did not stir as she came in to the room,
nor raise his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well!” sighed Bertha, as she moved to her writing-table,
stacked with papers in orderly pigeon-holes and
bearing a goodly pile of unopened letters. “How dreadfully
work accumulates, even during a week. Here are all
those leaflets for the Mothers’ Union that ought to have
gone out last week. Minnie really is a fool. And she forwarded
all the wrong letters to me, too, and none of the
right ones. I must answer half these to-night.”</p>

<p>She sat down, and drew paper and ink towards her.</p>

<p>At the first sound which indicated that her pen was fairly
started, Frederick put down his newspaper and spoke.</p>

<p>“Well Bertha, as you have had your way in the matter
of bringing these children home with you, I suppose we
had better come to an understanding on the subject.”</p>

<p>He invariably called his wife Bertha.</p>

<p>“No, dear, not to-night,” said Mrs. Tregaskis with
pseudo-firmness. “I have to deal with all these letters.”</p>

<p>Frederick, who knew his wife, remained silent.</p>

<p>In a moment she resumed with spirit:</p>

<p>“Besides, what is there to discuss? I wrote to you when
poor Rose Grantham died and said that I wanted to take
her children, and give them a home. The alternative was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
either a cheap school, or the raking up of some third-rate
foreign relation who might have been paid to look after
them. I told you that it seemed to be—how shall I put
it?—plus fort que moi—the impulse simply to take and—and
love them.”</p>

<p>“I do not like impulses,” said Frederick coldly, “but you
do not often—I might almost say ever—act on impulse,
Bertha.”</p>

<p>She laughed angrily. “I’m very glad to hear you say so,
since I’m always trying to learn caution, but as a matter of
fact you are utterly mistaken, as you very often are where
I am concerned. I’ve been exceedingly impetuous all my
life, and I haven’t outgrown it yet. Of course I know very
well that only an impetuous woman would have suggested
adopting two children like that—but, upon my word, I’d
rather trust to my love of children and take my risks.”</p>

<p>She drew up her fine figure as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Your risks, in this case, may safely be reckoned as
non-existent. On your own showing, Dick Grantham’s
money will bring in about three hundred a year to each of
his children until it passes into their own control. To feed
and clothe them meanwhile will cost perhaps a hundred a
year each, and leave a handsome margin for educational
and other expenses. There is no question of risk.”</p>

<p>“My dear man, I’ve been into the business part of it
from end to end and understand it perfectly—a great deal
better than you do, in all probability. That’s not the point.
There are other risks than monetary ones. Good Heavens!
if <i>that</i> was all one thought of!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean risks to the children themselves?”</p>

<p>“You know very well that I don’t. Little sheltered
happy things, what risks do they run, I should like to
know? But the responsibility is a big one for me—two
more to love and guard and teach, and turn into honest,
healthy, happy young women.”</p>

<p>“The constant society of Miss Blandflower is hardly
likely to do that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Poor Minnie! Why do you hate her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. But she is neither honest nor healthy nor
happy, and I therefore fail to see why you should expect
her to make her pupils so.”</p>

<p>“She is perfectly honest, Frederick. If she isn’t
healthy, it’s because she won’t take enough exercise, and
that whining voice doesn’t mean that she isn’t happy. It’s
only affectation.”</p>

<p>“If she’s affected she isn’t honest,” remarked Frederick,
scoring a point. “However, leave Miss Blandflower out
of it. I’m talking of the Grantham children. Why don’t
you send them to school?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Bertha, her eyes blazing, “they are two
motherless children, and no woman with a heart worth the
name would have them anywhere but under her own wing.
My heart is big enough to take in three children, thank God—yes,
and as many more as may need me.”</p>

<p>Quoth Frederick, utterly unmoved:</p>

<p>“They would be happier at school.”</p>

<p>“They would be miserable there. Two spoilt, uneducated,
delicate children. They’d be hopelessly out of their
element.”</p>

<p>“Not so much so as they will be here.”</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis, her face suffused with agitation, began
to pace up and down the room.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you won’t keep them, you won’t. But I
don’t pretend to see your point of view.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“If you’re thinking of all I have to do,” she returned
in softened tones, “I’ll manage somehow. It’s better to
wear out than to rust out, and it’s little enough one can do.
But as long as there’s life in me, my motto will always be
the old one: ‘Lend a hand.’”</p>

<p>“That is precisely where I anticipate danger.”</p>

<p>“What danger?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“Danger to Rosamund and Frances Grantham,” said
Frederick acidly, turning out his reading lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Bertha Tregaskis remained long in the library after he
had gone upstairs. She knew that her husband’s opposition
would find no further expression in words, and that her
authority with the children would remain undisputed.</p>

<p>With a sigh she turned to the papers on her desk, and
wrote steadily for nearly two hours, directing, encouraging,
organizing, and again advising. Finally she spent some
fifteen minutes on a letter to Lady Argent, of which the
final page may be quoted:</p>

<p>“So you see, Sybil, my dear, it’s not going to be quite all
plain sailing. But then one never expected that, and the
privilege of <i>giving</i> is so great that one doesn’t count the
cost. After all, in all this sad old earth, the one and only
thing that counts is Love, and the realest, most sacred form
of it, when all’s said and done, is that of a mother for her
children. Most of us find that out too late, but I don’t
mean my bairns to if I can help it!</p>

<p>“Good-night, my dear, it’s close on twelve and I’m dead
to the world. Just one look at my <i>three</i>, and then to bed.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WELL, Nina, you see I’ve trebled my responsibilities,”
observed Mrs. Tregaskis to her greatest
friend.</p>

<p>The greatest friend leant back in her chair and looked
exquisitely sympathetic.</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i>,” she murmured, in tones which prevented the
words from sounding too blatantly non-committal.</p>

<p>“You may say that I had my hands fairly full already,
one way and another,” said Bertha, who was frequently
obliged to resort to this oblique method of dragging to
light Nina Severing’s opinion, in order to set it right. “But
one simply couldn’t help it. Those poor little things
orphaned, and with no alternative but a cheap school. I
must own I acted on impulse—which I’m rather apt to do,
I’m afraid, though I deplore the tendency—but somehow
one hasn’t quite outgrown one’s youthful impetuosity——”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Nina Severing with widely open childlike
eyes; “but indeed I <i>quite</i> think you’ve left all that behind,
Bertie dear. I always envy your wonderful clear-headed
prudence and far-seeing ways. I’m sure you’re quite the
last person to be carried away by an impulse—so unlike
my silly self, as I always say! But then I was left to be
my own guide and mistress so very young—a child.
Looking back, I could sometimes almost cry at the thought
of that pitiful little figure—a child of twenty, with nothing
left but another child to take care of, a memory—and—a
star.”</p>

<p>Bertha knew of old her friend’s passion for analogy,
more poetical than exact, and had no intention of inquiring
into the antecedents of the star. Besides, she was well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
aware that Nina Severing was a musician, and had no difficulty
in connecting the astral body in question with the
composition of several extremely popular drawing-room
songs.</p>

<p>She said: “I simply took those two and told them——”</p>

<p>“Not a seventh sound, but a star,” Nina quoted penetratingly,
immovably determined that her allusion should be
made perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Bertie, seeing that the star was not to be ignored, disposed
of it by a hurried but sufficiently intense-sounding
“Ah—one knows what music means——” She might
have added “to you,” but for Nina’s gentle movement of
acquiescence, unmistakably claiming and sheltering all music
as her own.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, I simply wrote straight to Frederick and
asked if we <i>could</i> do anything else than take those two little
solitary things home. Of course it isn’t an actual expense,
because that wouldn’t be fair to one’s own belongings—they’ve
got quite enough to make it possible. But the other
things are what matter, after all.”</p>

<p>“Alas! who knows that better than I do?” sighed Nina,
a widow, and a rich woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis, a poor one, instantly observed, “Not that
it doesn’t imply a good many actual material little sacrifices,
which perhaps may pinch here and there—but who would
think twice about that? When people tell me that I’m an
improvident woman, I never can help thinking of the dear
old French saying: ‘Chaque enfant apporte son pain sous
le bras.’”</p>

<p>To which Nina, who spoke no French, promptly retorted
with much presence of mind:</p>

<p>“Dicunt. Quod dicunt? Dicant! That has been my
answer for years to people who can’t mind their own business.”</p>

<p>The classical nature of this <i>riposte</i> left her so content that
she was able to ask with affectionate interest:</p>

<p>“And do tell me how it all works? Of course they appeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
to me, if only as the children of an intensely musical
mother. I heard her play once, I remember—oh, ages
ago—when I was in London. Rather a striking-looking
woman, and the eldest girl reminded me of her at once. It
somehow gave me a little pang—it seemed to bring back
that concert, years ago when Geoffrey and I were together.”</p>

<p>Bertha was too familiar with the singular power that the
most unlikely incidents possessed of recalling Nina’s happier
hours to accord more than a passing acknowledgment
towards this tender tribute to the past.</p>

<p>“My poor dear,” she murmured rapidly. “Rosamund
is like her mother, but she reminds me of poor Dick Grantham
too. My cousin, you know; we were almost brought
up together.”</p>

<p>Her sigh was perhaps intended to remind Nina that she
held no monopoly of lost relatives. “They seem dear children,
and very easy to understand, though really I always
think that to understand children is a sort of God-given
knack, which one is simply lucky enough to possess.”</p>

<p>“One” does not sound particularly egotistical, and conveys
“I” quite successfully to a practised listener.</p>

<p>“They’re very backward about lessons, poor little things;
and just imagine! neither of them has ever held a needle or
been taught to keep accounts! Why, at ten years old I remember
making my own pinafores and darning the boys’
socks!”</p>

<p>“Ah well, you’ll teach them all that kind of thing too
beautifully—<i>so</i> useful and necessary,” declared Nina negligently,
“though I’m afraid I’ve rather a sneaking sympathy
for unpractical, helpless creatures like myself. Poor
Geoffrey used to tell me that I was too ornamental to be
really useful. One can say it at this distance of time, without
being thought vain by the unimaginative.”</p>

<p>Having thus skilfully precluded the possibility of
Bertha’s attributing her innocent anecdote to vanity, Nina
added tenderly:</p>

<p>“You’re so wonderful about clever, practical things, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
know. You and I, I always think, Bertie dear, are like
Martha and Mary—you know—the two types of active
and contemplative, as it were.”</p>

<p>Bertie had heard this Scriptural parallel before, and was
not in love with it.</p>

<p>“Oh, one has one’s hours for dreaming, of course,” she
replied lightly, but with a distinct frigidity. “But with a
husband and house, and those three children, I simply <i>must</i>
put my shoulder to the wheel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. I always wish I had your sense of responsibility.
I’m afraid I’m dreadfully apt to feel that my
little songs are all the work I’m meant to do, having once
given a son to the nation,” sighed Nina, who was aware that
her friend had always regretted Hazel’s sex.</p>

<p>“How <i>is</i> Morris? Does he ever write?” was the subtle
rejoinder of Mrs. Tregaskis, uttered in markedly sympathetic
tones.</p>

<p>Morris Severing, aged seventeen, and his mother each
frequently told their numerous friends in confidence that
they did not understand one another. This was untrue—they
only understood one another too well.</p>

<p>“My poor Morris!” sighed Nina. “He will see things
so differently later on. Oh the <i>blindness</i> of youth, Bertie!
It makes one’s heart ache sometimes. When I think of the
stores of sad, sad, unavailing memories that my poor wayward,
foolish boy is laying up for himself, when it is all too
late!”</p>

<p>A certain complacency might have been detected in these
heartrending glimpses into the future.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Tregaskis said consolingly: “He will learn,
Nina. After all, he <i>is</i> so young—only a boy at Eton, for
all his ridiculous airs.”</p>

<p>“He looks a man already. No one will ever believe I
am the mother of that great tall creature—it’s simply too
absurd. I always think that’s the penalty we poor fair-haired
people have to pay.”</p>

<p>Nina Severing’s wavy hair was pale gold, barely flecked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
with grey, and her enormous eyes had up-curling golden
lashes.</p>

<p>“I don’t see much penalty about it,” Bertha remarked
with great truth. “But, of course, in a way it’s very much
better to have married later in life. One has so much more
to <i>give</i> one’s children. I was over thirty when Hazel was
born, and I’m simply thankful for it. All the added experience
and confidence one had acquired—it’s all helped to
make and form her little life. I do feel so strongly that a
mother ought absolutely to <i>make</i> her child, as it were—help
it and guide its development along the lines meant for it.
You know——”</p>

<p>“Hazel always seems to me such an extraordinarily self-contained
little girl,” Nina interrupted languidly.</p>

<p>“So she is. She gets that from me. She’s nearly as
reserved as I was at her age—except, of course, with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Bertie dear, don’t you think she gets it from
her father? Frederick always strikes me as <i>the</i> most reserved
man of my acquaintance. Though perhaps that’s
only the effect of my own reserve, which I believe reacts on
shy people.”</p>

<p>The quality popularly described as “reserve” is one to
which the majority of people cling passionately. Murderer,
thief, atheist if you will, but always strongly, impenetrably
reserved.</p>

<p>“I give myself away only when I am at the piano,” Nina
pursued her reflective way. “One’s art can never lie.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t malign yourself, dear,” said Bertie with a
hand laid fondly on her friend’s. “I assure you no one
could really look upon you as reserved—for one moment.
I’ve never thought you so.”</p>

<p>Nina gave her well-known childlike smile, and said
“Dear Bertie!” with her head rather on one side.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told me about Morris yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he writes from time to time—poor boy. You
know—the kind of letters that tell one nothing. It’s so curious
that so many many others should come to one for help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
or sympathy or advice and one’s own child prefer to turn
elsewhere. At least I suppose he turns elsewhere. Morris
is very expansive—quite unlike me,” said Nina firmly in
parenthesis, “and makes every sort and kind of friend, and
confides in them all without discrimination. Some day he
will know, I suppose, that he has only one true friend in all
the world—his mother.”</p>

<p>Bertha was suitably silent for a moment.</p>

<p>Then she asked tentatively: “What does he mean to do
later on? Oxford, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Of course, he really is most tiresome
about his music, poor boy; he thinks he wants to be a professional
pianist.”</p>

<p>“Toujours?” inquired Bertha with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Alas, yes! Of course it’s a boyish fancy and won’t last—besides,
when has Morris ever stuck to <i>anything</i>? But
you know what opposition is to any boy of that age—he
simply enjoys it and poses as a misunderstood genius—not
that I should say so to anyone on earth but you, Bertie.”</p>

<p>“Nina dear, of course I know that,” warmly said her
friend, who was perfectly well aware of the extensive area
covered by Nina’s deepest confidence.</p>

<p>“My dear,” Nina Severing declared, with wide-open
brown eyes, “it’s <i>absolute</i> nonsense. As you know, I
should be the very last person on earth to quench one single
spark of the Divine Fire in anyone, least of all in my own
nearest and dearest. But Morris has got absolutely nothing
more than an inherited gift, and a certain amount of
technical skill because I insisted, absolutely insisted, upon
his having really good teaching from the time he was quite a
little boy. He hasn’t got the temperament to get over the
footlights, to begin with.”</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis, at the slight tinge of expertism discernable
in Nina Severing’s tones, at once retorted firmly:</p>

<p>“Ah! getting over the ‘floats,’ in the slang of the profession,
isn’t easy in any art, as I know from my own small
dramatic experiences.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>She had some reputation as an amateur actress.</p>

<p>“No, is it?” agreed Nina gently. “I wish you’d talk to
Morris a little, Bertie dear, you <i>are</i> so sensible, and I know
he’d listen to you. He always looks upon <i>me</i> as too young,
more like a contemporary than a mother, you know. I suppose
it’s very natural.”</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Bertha tolerantly with raised eyebrows,
and contrived to insert into the monosyllable a distinct
quality of scepticism with regard to Nina’s supposition.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” she resumed briskly, after a moment in
which to allow Nina fully to appreciate the subtlety of her
retort, “I really think Morris might do worse than have a
talk with me. I’ve helped plenty of boys, and of girls, too,
for the matter of that, in my time. When Hazel comes out,
I tell her, she’ll be cut out by her old mother. My dear,
young men are always telling me they adore me, but, as I
say, it’s quite safe to adore an old gargoyle.”</p>

<p>She laughed heartily, and Nina murmured with the deprecating
smile she kept for such speeches, “How ridiculous
you are, Bertie. Do enrol my poor Morris into the regiment
of worshippers. I’m sure you could. It would do
him a lot of good to have his thoughts taken off himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s what one feels,” agreed Bertha. “Self-absorption
is a disease with modern youth.”</p>

<p>“Introspection carried to the verge of mania,” returned
Nina, no less psychologically. “When one thinks of what
one was at that sort of age, oneself!”</p>

<p>Bertha, however, appeared to feel that one might think of
what one was at that sort of age too frequently, and offered
her friend no encouragement to pursue this retrospective
path.</p>

<p>Instead, she rose from her low seat on the terrace and
remarked matter-of-factly that it was too cold to sit still for
long.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and have a look at the chicks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Are their lessons over?” inquired Nina Severing,
drawing her furs closer.</p>

<p>She had been wearing them loosely over one shoulder,
but such is the effect of suggestion.</p>

<p>“Certainly, or I shouldn’t go near them. You know
what a disciplinarian I am, Nina, and nothing is ever allowed
to interfere with regular hours for my little people.
It’s more than half the battle, in my opinion. Lessons, a
good long walk twice a day in all weathers, and plenty of
healthy play in the garden. Hazel thrives on it, and I mean
the other two to do the same.”</p>

<p>She gave her ready, jovial laugh.</p>

<p>“Lazy little cats, both of them! Rosamund would like
to sit over a story-book all day, and Frances says that walks
make her legs ache. I don’t believe they ever set foot outside
the garden in Monmouthshire. Their mother was
half a Hungarian, which, I suppose, accounts for it.”</p>

<p>“My sympathies are frightfully cosmopolitan, I’m
afraid,” sighed Nina, “but I do think you’re absolutely
right about the children, of course. Fresh air and exercise
are so important at that age.”</p>

<p>“At any age,” laughed her friend. “<i>I</i> couldn’t get
through my work without my daily tramp.”</p>

<p>Nina, with great skill, immediately assumed an appearance
irresistibly recalling a fragile hothouse plant.</p>

<p>“As you know,” she murmured, “<i>my</i> poor little art has
always had to thrive in spite of my wretched health. I’m
always trying to think myself a robust woman, but everyone
always laughs at me for so much as suggesting such a
thing.”</p>

<p>She imparted a tinge of pathos to her slight laugh.</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis, who did not for a moment suppose that
Nina had ever tried to think herself a robust woman in her
life, laughed also, but with a marked absence of pathos.
Before she could frame a further reply, however, they saw
Miss Blandflower and her three pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Who are these like stars appearing?” absently murmured
Miss Blandflower, within sight of them. “Run,
Hazel dear, there’s mother.”</p>

<p>Nobody ran, and the meeting took place with modified
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Nina Severing, who, in the abstract, adored children, did
not find very much to say to them, but interspersed her
infrequent remarks, which generally took the form of questions,
with numerous ejaculatory “darlings” which gave
a tone of intimacy to the proceedings.</p>

<p>“Do you remember Morris, darling?” she amiably inquired
of Hazel. “He’s coming back very soon for his
Christmas holidays. Won’t that be lovely?”</p>

<p>A month later this agreeable forecast was realized, and
Morris Severing was causing his mother acute anxiety in
the billiard-room at Pensevern.</p>

<p>“My dearest boy, won’t you believe that I know best?”</p>

<p>“Not in this case,” said her son with an implication
unjustified of their joint past, of innumerable other cases
in the background where he had unhesitatingly accepted
his mother’s judgments.</p>

<p>“My poor romantic darling,” cried the unwise Nina;
“because you know nothing of life, <i>nothing</i>, you think that
the career of a musician would amuse you, and that it would
be all easy success and triumph. But remember that I
<i>know</i>, and that a far, far greater talent than yours is necessary
to be of any use at all, my poor boy.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the point,” retorted Morris, white with fury.
“I don’t wish to be a popular success. In fact I’m not
suggesting a public career at all, for the present, but simply
a year or two’s study in Germany.”</p>

<p>“Because you think that it may lead to your becoming a
professional. If you weren’t absolutely breaking my heart,
Morris, I could laugh at the futility of such an idea, positively
laugh,” cried Nina tragically.</p>

<p>“Mother, how can you talk about it’s breaking your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
heart? What <i>can</i> it matter to you if I choose to make
music my career instead of some rotten profession for
which I have no aptitude?”</p>

<p>“Aptitude! What can you know of the meaning of the
word, at your age? Even I, after all these years of study
and toil and experience,” said Nina pathetically, “should
not dare to boast about an ‘aptitude’ as you do, my poor
Morris. The daring of ignorance indeed!”</p>

<p>By these and similar taunts, she always reduced him, in
their frequent disputes, to bitter, inarticulate rage and mortification.
He stood and looked at her, with his angry
young face set. He was a good-looking stripling, with his
mother’s light tawny hair, and blue eyes set in a sunburnt
face. His straight gaze and squarely-shaped jaw would
have denoted strength to a writer of fiction. His mouth, as
surely, would have typified weakness to an acute observer.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of being melodramatic?” cried Nina,
gazing at him coldly.</p>

<p>Each knew by intuition the other’s vulnerable spot.
Morris winced in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“You think that I mind that sort of accusation,” he said;
“but as a matter of fact, I should only mind it if it were
true. I am a great deal too much in earnest to be melodramatic,
or to be turned from my purpose by any sneers,
mother. I’ve wanted all my life to be a musician, and you
are the last person in the world who ought to discourage
me.”</p>

<p>“When you talk about ‘all your life,’ my poor darling,
it makes one smile. The life of a child of seventeen!
You will want something absolutely different in a year’s
time. When have you ever been known to stick to anything?”</p>

<p>“I’ve stuck to this, and I mean to stick to it. Why,
mother, you haven’t any reasonable grounds for opposing it
even. You only say that I haven’t got enough talent to
make a success of music.”</p>

<p>“Well, and who is better qualified to judge? I’ve had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
years of experience as a composer, and I’ve seen as much of
the professional life as though I’d belonged to it, as you
very well know. People whom I hardly know, and perfect
strangers, come to me for advice, and even musicians of
experience, because they are wise enough to know that one
<i>can</i> help them. But you, my own son, and a mere boy,
think that you know better than I do. I tell you it’s preposterous,
Morris!”</p>

<p>He stood silent, glaring at her. “It’s my own life,” he
said at last, sullenly.</p>

<p>“That’s a very old argument. But is nothing owing to
the mother who gave you that life, took care of your babyhood
and childhood, had you educated and taught everything
you know, from whom, my poor boy, you even derive
what talent you may possess? Why, everything you have
in the world is owing to your mother and father.”</p>

<p>Morris, furiously conscious that his mother was taking
her stand upon false ground yet found no answer to that
which he had heard a hundred times before.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” cried Nina, pursuing her advantage,
“that you have a single <i>real</i> friend in the world, besides
your mother? I know you boast as though you had always
been popular wherever you went—you know best how
much truth there is in it—but the people who flatter you
and say they like you, have all been bought with my money.
<i>I’ve</i> sent you to expensive schools, and allowed you to stay
with anybody who asked you, and God knows I’m glad you
should have friends and enjoy your youth. You can never
say that I’ve grudged you anything, Morris.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know very well you’ve given me every sort of
thing,” he muttered. “I’ve never been ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“As though I wanted gratitude!” she cried in a sort
of holy scorn. “You know very well, Morris, that I love
you better than anyone else in the world—you are all I
have left—and for seventeen years you’ve been my only
thought, day or night. It’s very, very little I ask of you in
return—only a little affection and unselfishness. Youth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
very hard and ignorant, and one doesn’t ask much in return
for all one gives.”</p>

<p>She suddenly pitched her voice three semitones lower.</p>

<p>“But the day will come, my poor Morris, when you will
look back with wonder and bitter, bitter regret, to think that
you refused to do the very little asked of you. And it will
be too late then.”</p>

<p>As a little boy she had always worked on his feelings,
since he was impressionable and highly-strung, but custom
had dulled his sensibilities. But still he could not do more
than look at her with anger and distrust in his young tragic
gaze.</p>

<p>Nina slowly allowed the tears to well into her enormous
eyes. They were always obedient to her summons, as are
the tears of most physically delicate women, and, moreover,
she was really agitated at the thought that Morris would not
accept her judgment as infallible.</p>

<p>“Morris, darling, don’t go away from me. I have only
you, now, whom Geoffrey left to be my comfort sixteen
years ago. If you went to Germany I should not be able to
come with you”—Morris looked his consternation at the
possibility of such a proceeding—“whereas if you go to
Oxford, which is what your beloved father wished for you,
you can come back here after a year or two, and we can decide
together what you would care to go in for.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing for me to do here.”</p>

<p>“The place wants looking after. Mr. Bartlett is very
good, but he’s only the agent. You’re too young to understand
how very very difficult it has been for me to cope with
all the business ever since your father died. I’ve done it all
for your sake, Morris, looking forward to the time when you
would be able to take it off my hands yourself. Don’t disappoint
me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to disappoint you, mother. But you know
yourself what it is to care about music. Surely you wouldn’t
grudge me a few years’ study?”</p>

<p>“That could come later, if you still wish it. The idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
your being a professional is absurd, and I will never hear of
it, but I don’t say I shouldn’t let you go to Germany for a
while <i>after</i> Oxford, though it is naturally very bitter to me
that my only son should wish to leave home, and his widowed
mother, when there is absolutely no reason for it. It isn’t
as though you had to earn your own living. Everything I
have will be yours one day.”</p>

<p>“I can’t live on you for ever,” said Morris angrily. His
father’s will, made before Morris was born, had left everything
unreservedly to Nina.</p>

<p>“There’s no question of your living on me. You are my
only child, and everything that is mine is yours,” tearfully
exclaimed Nina, who gave her son a fixed moderate allowance,
and had never allowed him to know the extent either of
her fortune or her income, still less to infringe in the slightest
degree upon her absolute power as mistress of the estate.</p>

<p>“Besides, I want your help.”</p>

<p>A servant opened the door.</p>

<p>“If you please, madam, Mr. Bartlett is here, and would
like to speak to you a moment.”</p>

<p>Decidedly, the stars were fighting for Nina Severing.
She rose, with a gentle, sorrowful glance at her son.</p>

<p>“More business,” she sighed wearily, and left the room
with her tardy, trailing step.</p>

<p>Morris, left alone, became instantly inspired with a number
of conclusive arguments and dignified retorts which
should have left his parent defenceless. He went through
several imaginary conversations, with eloquence and reason
on his side. But imaginary victories are but poor consolation
for a defeat. Presently Morris groaned, ran his fingers
through his thick hair, and muttered half aloud:</p>

<p>“Thwarted at every step. It’s enough to make one take
the law into one’s own hands and <i>go</i>.”</p>

<p>He was always slightly dramatic, even when alone.
“What is there for a man to do down here? Mother won’t
even get a car.”</p>

<p>He reflected gloomily that few other chaps of his acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
were unable so much as to drive a motor-car, and then
rebounded hastily on to the more exalted plane.</p>

<p>“Besides—music! It’s the only thing on earth. I shall
go mad if I can’t take it up properly.”</p>

<p>His eyes lighted up, very much as he meant them to do,
with the fire of the enthusiast, and he paced the room rapidly.</p>

<p>Presently a note in his mother’s handwriting was brought
to him. His brow clouded. Nina’s written appeals, of
which she was, like most weak natures, prodigal, never failed
to irritate Morris, who had not yet learnt to be eloquent on
paper.</p>

<p>“Darling,” she wrote with many dashes and splashes of
her pen, “do not wait for luncheon. I shall be some time
with Mr. Bartlett, and cannot interrupt business. Do think
over our talk. I had a little surprise for you these holidays,
which I meant to tell you later, but perhaps it may cheer you
up. I am going to get the car you wanted so much, and Mr.
Bartlett tells me he knows of a very good place in Bodmin.
We might go in to-morrow and see, and perhaps arrange for
some driving lessons for you. It will help you to get at some
good music, too, and lessons, if you want them, later.”</p>

<p>Morris stood confounded. By such unexpected <i>volte
faces</i> and sudden generosities, did his mother cause all his
resentment to appear ungrateful and futile. He felt angry
with her, and at the same time touched, and ashamed of his
own anger. Perhaps most of all he felt bewildered. Then
he thought of the motor-car, his ambition for the past two
years. It would make all the difference to Pensevern. He
saw himself, a dashing, reckless driver, yet skilled in hair-breadth
escapes, leaning back in the driving-seat with his cap
pulled over his eyes, and one careless hand on the wheel—negligent,
cool, yet infinitely competent.</p>

<p>These pleasing reveries were not new to Morris, but they
had never before been illuminated by any spark of probability.
He was happy for some time. But presently he became
once more gloomy.</p>

<p>No number of motor-cars would convey him to Germany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
or enable him to make music his career. The motor-car was
his mother’s bribe to keep him at home.</p>

<p>Morris flushed at the thought, and tried to ignore a subconscious
conviction, rapidly forcing itself upon him, that a
motor-car in the garage was worth more than a career in
the future.</p>

<p>It was, of course, absurd. Motor-cars did not alter the
whole course of a man’s lifetime.</p>

<p>Did his mother really mean it? Morris turned to her
letter again. It was explicit enough, and he was also struck
by the note of appeal sounded. Inspiration came to him
slowly. The appeal of a widowed mother! Might not the
whole ambition of a lifetime be worthily sacrificed to <i>that</i>?
Motor-cars might, as it were, be flung in by an admiring
Providence, but they should not be allowed to affect the main
issue.</p>

<p>The vision of the dashing young mechanic was hastily
relinquished in favour of that of a morose, disappointed
man, his career sacrificed to the whim of his mother, his
passion for music thwarted by harsh circumstances in early
youth.</p>

<p>“The world has lost a great musician there,” he fancied
might be the sorrowful reply to inquiries about the strong,
silent figure whose story would be so well known to every
tenant on the estate in the long years to come.</p>

<p>“I will stay. I will give it all up,” declared Morris to himself,
and felt a genuine pang at the renunciation.</p>

<p>The pang, recurring at ever-widening intervals, was
destined to remain a source of satisfaction to him for a number
of years.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MORRIS SEVERING reappears in these pages, after
an indifferently successful but lighthearted career
at Oxford, not as a disappointed genius, but as an
extremely good-looking young man, in love with life, with his
own universal popularity, and with the goddess of music.</p>

<p>That he should seriously fall in love with a more earthly
divinity was at once Nina’s hope and her terror. She
watched the three little girls at Porthlew growing up rapidly,
and spent the long vacations with her son abroad or in London.
He was very little at Pensevern until the summer when
Mrs. Tregaskis took Hazel and Rosamund to London.</p>

<p>Frances Grantham, only sixteen, and delicate, remained at
Porthlew with Miss Blandflower “to keep Cousin Frederick
company,” Mrs. Tregaskis told her.</p>

<p>Nina was not very much afraid that her son would fall in
love with Frances. She was pretty, in a slender, classical
style, but lacking in vitality, and though she came up to Pensevern
and played tennis and, occasionally, golf, with Morris,
she did so with the curious lack of conviction that was characteristic
of her dealings with the material world.</p>

<p>From a psychological point of view Frances was infinitely
more mature than Rosamund, passionate and unbalanced,
or than Hazel, possessed of a sense of humour (which both
sisters lacked almost completely), and charming withal; but
Nina Severing, with great acumen, decided that only Frances
could safely be promoted to the rank of “my little favourite.”</p>

<p>Her little favourite, being idealistic and impressionable,
conceived a youthful adoration for Nina’s gentle tones, appealing
prettiness, and tuneful graces, and refrained, with a
completeness which spoke highly for Nina’s judgment, from
transferring any of that adoration to Nina’s son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>As for Morris, it was enough that he once heard Frances
Grantham, with transparent sincerity, observe that the modern
music she liked best was Mrs. Severing’s highly successful
setting of half a dozen <i>nouveau genre</i> lyrics, entitled
“Underworld.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather odd that only one of them should have inherited
the mother’s gift,” observed Nina thoughtfully, after
this. “Of course she’s no performer, but that curious instinct
for <i>the right thing</i> is absolutely inborn.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Rosamund was musical,” said Morris,
purposely and viciously misunderstanding his parent, and
moreover making it perfectly clear to that parent’s acute perceptions
why he did so. She set her lips together and assumed
the look of pale self-control that habitually prefaced
her most bitter shafts.</p>

<p>“I’m just telling you that <i>Frances</i> is the only one of the
two who has any music in her. Rosamund is absolutely
devoid of it. If you had any spark of the Divine Fire in
you, my dear boy, you could not have helped recognizing it in
little Frances, even though she can hardly play a note. But,
after all, one doesn’t expect much perception from youth.”</p>

<p>She murmured the last words as though to herself, which
added considerably to their effect.</p>

<p>Morris, who was seldom able to think of any satisfactory
repartee to his mother’s favourite gibe, hastily decided that a
good-humoured indifference would best refute it. He gave
a slight laugh, shrugged his shoulders so as to make quite
sure that Nina did not miss the point of the laugh, and observed
lightly:</p>

<p>“I hear Hazel Tregaskis sings delightfully. She always
was good, even as a kid.”</p>

<p>“Quite good,” agreed Nina, with that air of condescension
best calculated to irritate her son. “Her voice is a charming
one, but, of course, she has to <i>live</i> before she can really
<i>sing</i>.” She hesitated for an instant, since the obvious slighting
allusion to youth could hardly be brought in without some
appearance of repeating a good effect <i>ad nauseam</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Morris, with his usual fatal perception, instantly took
advantage of her slightly disconcerted pause, for which he
perfectly grasped the reason, to say pleasantly: “I shall be
able to judge when I hear her.” Upon which, having established
his own perfect competence to form an independent
opinion, he hastily left the room.</p>

<p>That night they went to dinner at Porthlew, and he heard
Hazel Tregaskis sing.</p>

<p>Her voice, as Nina had said, was charming, and she played
her own accompaniments.</p>

<p>Nina sat well in the lamplight, an absorbed, dreamy look
on her face, and her long, slight fingers slowly twisting her
wedding ring, with a gesture which through long years of
conscious pathos, had become habitual to her. Frederick
Tregaskis, smaller and more wizened than ever, was frankly
asleep in an armchair. His wife, devotedly knitting socks,
yet contrived to present an attitude of critical intentness for
her daughter’s performance.</p>

<p>Frances was sitting at the open window, her pure, vague
gaze fixed unseeingly on the darkened garden without.
Morris scarcely glanced at her a moment.</p>

<p>His eyes sought Rosamund, who had been beside him at
dinner.</p>

<p>She was sitting, very still, just outside the circle of light
cast by the great standard lamp. Morris had already noticed
her capacity for extreme stillness, oddly at variance
with the restless questing spirit that looked out of her grey
eyes, and certain vibrant tones of her singularly beautiful
speaking-voice. Watching her motionless profile, Morris
thought that the Slavonic type was strangely emphasized in
the sharply defined moulding of the salient cheek-bones, sulkily
closed lips, and straight black brows. Her skin was very
white, and her brown hair thick and silky. Morris thought
her very beautiful.</p>

<p>He wondered what her thoughts were, as she leant back
in her low chair, immovable. Presently, with that sureness
of intuition which is at once a pitfall and a safeguard, Morris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
perceived that she was listening—intently, with every fibre
of her being drawn tense.</p>

<p>Hazel’s voice was a soprano of no great compass, well-trained,
and with an indefinably pathetic quality which gave
it charm, but the drawing-room ballads she had chosen to
give them seemed to Morris trivial in the extreme. He had
hardly been listening.</p>

<p>He wondered what Rosamund Grantham heard in the
clear soft notes.</p>

<p>When Hazel had sung once or twice, and had received
Nina Severing’s judicious comments with a sort of half-mocking
deference that recalled her father’s manner, she
turned to Morris.</p>

<p>“Now you’ll play to us, won’t you?” she appealed.</p>

<p>“Do,” cried Bertha heartily. “I haven’t heard you for
years, Morris.”</p>

<p>“His execution has improved, of course,” remarked Nina,
who was fond of discussing her son’s music in his own presence.</p>

<p>“Bodmin teaching is not all it might be,” was the retort
of Morris, addressed to Mrs. Tregaskis. “I’ve had to do
the best I can by myself.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy!” protested his mother, with a laugh that
to her son’s practised ear betrayed annoyance. “As though
you hadn’t had the best lessons obtainable in Paris!”</p>

<p>“Half a dozen—oh yes. They certainly helped me to
carry on alone afterwards.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had your mother to help you, my boy; mustn’t
forget that,” suddenly said Frederick Tregaskis from his
corner. He chuckled a little: “Mustn’t forget that.”</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> play something to us, Morris,” interposed Hazel
quickly. She looked at him with the eternal laugh dancing
in her pretty eyes.</p>

<p>But Morris had turned to Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Shall I?” he asked her, aware of the subtlety of such
an appeal.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said gently, looking at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Morris possessed an almost irresistible attraction, one
which is sometimes the attribute of weak natures—an exceedingly
direct gaze.</p>

<p>He looked straight at Rosamund, and his eyes smiled at
her.</p>

<p>“Then I am going to play to you,” he said under his
breath, with the lightest possible emphasis. He turned to
the piano at once, but not before he had seen the colour
surge up into her face.</p>

<p>He gave them the gayest, wildest, most heartrending of
Brahms’ Hungarian dances. When he ceased there was silence
for a moment. Nina Severing turned so that the
lamplight fell on her long lashes, sparkling a little with tears.
She always cried a little at music which deserved to be
called good, and she had never heard Morris play so well.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Morris,” said Bertha, less exuberantly than
usual. “That’s a glorious thing—always rouses the gipsy
in me. It’s so full of life and joy and ecstasy.”</p>

<p>“There is something curiously <i>poignant</i> underneath that
ecstasy,” murmured Nina, partly to account for the sparkle
on her eyelashes and partly to make it clear that Bertie did
not by any means know all that there was to be known about
Brahms.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” softly said Hazel, elliptical,
after the fashion of the modern generation.</p>

<p>“It’s your turn again now. Please sing this,” he said,
with an engaging mixture of supplication and command in
his tone.</p>

<p>He had picked up one of the songs strewing the table,
almost at random, but she took it without demur, and advanced
to the piano. Under cover of the opening bars he
moved straight to where Rosamund sat in the shadow.</p>

<p>His eyes sought hers, with a question in them. For a
minute she remained quite still, her dark head bent. Then
she raised it, and he saw that her eyes were blazing with
intense excitement. “Oh it’s glorious,” she breathed, “to
be able to play like that! It takes one right away from—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> 
this.” She looked contemptuously at her surroundings.</p>

<p>“Do you care so very much?” he asked under his breath.
“Is music all that to you?”</p>

<p>“But I’m not musical,” she said with defiant honesty.
“It only makes me forget everything else.”</p>

<p>Understanding flashed into Morris’s expressive face. At
the same instant Nina turned towards him with a sharp
hissing sound of distress and a prolonged “Hush-sh—<i>Morris</i>.”</p>

<p>He was silent instantly.</p>

<p>When Hazel’s song was over Nina Severing asked for
her motor.</p>

<p>“It has been so nice, dearest,” she murmured, embracing
her hostess. “I’ve missed you too dreadfully all the
summer, and now you’ll be off again in a week, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, escorting my two young gadabouts to various
country houses. I’m an old-fashioned woman, and don’t let
my girls stay away alone, you know, unless I’m very sure of
the house they’re going to. One would prefer one’s own
chimney-corner, of course, but that’s neither here nor there.”</p>

<p>She laughed cheerily.</p>

<p>“For the matter of that,” cut in Hazel incisively, “I
should much prefer the chimney-corner myself, mother, and
so would Rosamund. You know how we’ve begged you to
let us spend the autumn here in peace.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, yes, yes,” scoffed her mother good-humouredly.
“I’ve heard little girls say that before, my darling.”</p>

<p>Nina, too, laughed softly.</p>

<p>“We mothers make our sacrifices for these young things
in spite of themselves,” she declared lightly. “Good-night,
Hazel. I hear you dance better than any girl in London.
Make the most of your time, my dear. Good-night, Francie
dear. Why, you’ve been as quiet as a little mouse all the
evening. It’s very hard to play Cinderella, isn’t it, with your
two ugly sisters going to the Ball every night?”</p>

<p>They all laughed as though the time-worn allusion had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
not been made with almost daily regularity by Miss Blandflower.</p>

<p>Frederick opened the door and Nina swept gracefully into
the hall. Frances ran eagerly for her cloak, and the others
came out more slowly.</p>

<p>On the dark threshold of the porch Morris spoke to Rosamund.</p>

<p>“I want to see you—I want to talk to you,” he said
urgently. “Can’t I play to you again—just to you all
alone? Though for the matter of that I played that Brahms
to you. You did know, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>He spoke with an odd inconsequence that was characteristic
of his ardent, eager temperament.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you did,” she murmured, not coquettishly,
but almost sadly, with a sort of uncertainty in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Can’t I come over to-morrow? I must come. Where
shall I find you?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Morris?” called Bertha Tregaskis.</p>

<p>“Coming,” he cried, and gave Rosamund one look before
dashing into the hall.</p>

<p>She did not speak to him again, but he held her hand for
an instant at parting and said “Good-night, Rosamund,”
blessing the wonderful privilege of childhood which had
allowed him always to use her Christian name.</p>

<p>Only a week and she would have gone away again! But
doubt and diffidence were almost equally strangers to Morris,
and he wove illimitable dreams into that space of eight
days as he drove from Porthlew to Pensevern in the dark
of an August night.</p>

<p>The following afternoon he went to find Rosamund.
She had given him no trysting-place—had not even said
that he might come—but Morris knew no uncertainty. He
did not go to the house, but sought the shade of the terrace,
and found her alone, in the short avenue that led to Bertha’s
cherished rock-garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>She was even paler than usual as she gave him her hand,
and Morris, with the intuition that was always his surest
guide, greeted her very gently and gravely.</p>

<p>“Where were you going to?” he asked. “May I come
with you?”</p>

<p>“I was going into the orchard. It’s cooler there. The
others have gone out.”</p>

<p>Morris did not dare to ask her why she had not gone
with them. He longed to hear her make the admission that
she had been waiting for him, but contented himself with
walking beside her in silence as she directed her steps
towards the sloping paddock that had been converted into
an orchard.</p>

<p>There was a wooden bench set in the furthest corner, and
Rosamund sat down there without speaking. Morris flung
himself upon the grass.</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>Then Morris, looking up at her, said:</p>

<p>“Tell me about everything. Everything that the Hungarian
dance made you feel last night, and why you say that
you’re not musical, and—everything.”</p>

<p>She did not tell him everything. But she told him, with a
curious mixture of childish simplicity and of a most unchildish
vehemence, a great deal; more even than she knew.</p>

<p>Morris listened, understood in a sort of passion of sympathy,
and looked all the while at her beautiful, unsmiling
face.</p>

<p>He noticed that she was strangely impersonal. She
hardly spoke of people at all, except once, when she said,
“I have always got Francie. I love her better than anyone
in the world.” Of her guardian she did not say anything.
But a lesser intuition than that of Morris Severing
would have felt an intense rebelliousness to be the keynote
of her whole life at Porthlew.</p>

<p>The magic afternoon sped by, and the shadows lengthened
across the grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Hazel Tregaskis called “Rosamund!” from the terrace,
and they looked at one another with eyes that had suddenly
awakened to another reality.</p>

<p>Morris sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Rosamund,” he said softly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the laugh appeared again in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you know, we’ve known one another four—five—years,
and I’ve never really <i>found</i> you till last night!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I found myself till you played the Hungarian
dance,” Rosamund told him seriously.</p>

<p>Hazel did not express any surprise at seeing Morris Severing.
He surmised that she would not often express surprise.
The charming assurance which characterized her
seemed to imply that Hazel Tregaskis would accept or ignore
very much as she chose, with little or no reference to any
standards but her own.</p>

<p>“Have you come to tea, Morris?” she inquired easily.
“Mother’s on the terrace. Isn’t it a shame to think of
leaving the garden and everything next week?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Morris energetically. “It’s perfectly rotten.
Where are you going? Must you go?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” she returned, shrugging her shoulders.
“We’ve both told mother how much we should prefer to
refuse invitations to shooting-parties, but she won’t hear
of it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll enjoy them when you’re there,” morosely remarked
Morris, with a sudden vision of Rosamund watching
some ass bringing down partridges by the dozen. Morris
was not a good shot.</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it!” cried Hazel with mock pathos.
“Of course I shall! I always do enjoy going anywhere, and
then mother says, ‘What did I tell you?’ Now Rosamund
at least has the satisfaction of being consistent. She is quite
genuinely bored wherever we go. She didn’t even enjoy
going to dances.”</p>

<p>Morris looked much relieved.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you really?” he asked Rosamund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Not much,” she admitted.</p>

<p>It was the last satisfaction that he obtained that afternoon.
Mrs. Tregaskis, with a readiness born of long habit,
made her guest useful by requesting him to roll the tennis
lawn, while Rosamund and Frances hunted languidly
amongst the bushes for tennis balls lost the previous afternoon.
Hazel had prudently disappeared.</p>

<p>“Economy, economy!” shouted Mrs. Tregaskis blithely,
and hacked with a racquet at the long grass concealing the
roots amongst which possible tennis balls might be imbedded.</p>

<p>Morris wondered if the same admirable virtue caused his
hostess to refrain from inviting him to stay and dine at
Porthlew that evening, but when she showed no such inclination
at seven o’clock he felt obliged to exclaim:</p>

<p>“I say, how late it is! I must be getting back.”</p>

<p>“Give my love to your mother,” said Bertha cordially.
“She must come over again before we go up North.”</p>

<p>“I’ll drive her over,” declared Morris with alacrity.
“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>All that evening he was haunted by Rosamund’s deep
eyes, by the sound of her sweet, serious voice. He told
himself exultantly that he had met his ideal, and that he,
and he alone was capable of loving her as she should be
loved. He also cursed himself as a cold-blooded fool for
not having told her then and there of his love. What senseless
scruple had restrained him? He resolved to see her
again the next day.</p>

<p>Rosamund, that night, lay awake till dawn in an excitement
that was as utterly out of proportion as were all her
emotions. She told herself, in pure and single-minded
earnestness, that this, which was to transmute her life to
gold, was different to anything else in the world.</p>

<p>Morris, who had fallen in love before, also told himself,
with fiery determination, that <i>this</i> was different to anything
else in the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THE sooner I pack up my young lady and take her
off to Scotland, the better, I think,” said Bertha
decisively.</p>

<p>“It’s all so silly,” sighed Nina vaguely. “But I really
don’t know—I shouldn’t mind it, you know, Bertie, if he
seriously wants it—only I think he’s too young. I’ve
always hoped he’d marry a daughter of yours, and Rosamund’s
as good as your daughter, though between ourselves,
I’ve always been fonder of both the other two.”</p>

<p>“Well—it may do very well when he’s a little older.
But don’t take it too seriously, Nina, my dear; it’s only a violent
admiration for a pretty face.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been proposing to her, or anything ridiculous
of that kind?” asked Nina nervously.</p>

<p>“Not that I know of, dear. He must know very well
that, situated as he is, he can’t possibly think of marrying—unless,
of course, you made it possible for him.”</p>

<p>“Of course, in a way, I want to see him married.”</p>

<p>“Not at that age, dearest. Why, the boy can’t know his
own mind.”</p>

<p>“No. Poor Morris! And he is frightfully unbalanced.”</p>

<p>“So’s she,” said Bertha Tregaskis quickly. “Her be a
right-down fulish li’l maid, I tells ’er.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve spoken to her?”</p>

<p>“Only laughed at her in a wholesome way, my dear.
Neither she nor Frances have a vestige of humour about
them—everything is always <i>au grand serieux</i>. That’s one
reason why I don’t believe she and Morris would ever really
suit one another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Nina deftly seized her opportunity.</p>

<p>“Morris certainly has inherited my sense of humour,” she
observed pensively.</p>

<p>“Why, the other day he laughed so much at one of those
stupid dialect imitations of mine, that I simply had to stop
and chuckle myself. It was too infectious,” cried Bertie,
with a laugh at the recollection.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” smiled Nina tolerantly, and leaving it uncertain
whether or not she was pitying Morris for his easy
appreciation of Cornish rusticisms as rendered by Mrs.
Tregaskis. “But, seriously, Bertie dear, it would be no bad
thing if later on they are both in earnest—only just at present
I think we’d better be hard-hearted, and not let it come
to anything definite.”</p>

<p>“It’s unlucky that visit of ours having fallen through,”
observed Bertha thoughtfully. “It keeps us here for another
ten days before the Scotch visits, and I can’t very well
forbid Morris to come to the house.”</p>

<p>“He’s there morning, noon, and night, I’m afraid,” sighed
Nina.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I flatter myself that I know how to manage a
youngster of his age. I’ll see if I can’t get an opportunity to
make Master Morris see reason.”</p>

<p>The opportunity was ahead of her.</p>

<p>At Porthlew Rosamund, coming downstairs, saw Morris
wandering aimlessly round the hall.</p>

<p>At the sound of her footfall he looked up, and came
towards her, impetuous and good-looking.</p>

<p>“Oh, Morris!” she cried.</p>

<p>He was halfway up the stairs and had caught both her
hands in his.</p>

<p>“Rosamund, darling!” The grip of her strong, slender
hands answered his, but there was a sort of questioning
sound in her exclamation.</p>

<p>“Dearest,” said Morris with gentle surprise, “you know I
adore you, don’t you? Don’t you love me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis, entering the hall briskly, in spite of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
long, hot walk, found them on the stairs, Morris holding
Rosamund’s hands in his, and gazing up at her with adoration
in his handsome, boyish face.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, what have we here?” cried Bertha, with sufficient
lightness in her tone to render a reply unnecessary.
“Rosamund, you ought to be out of doors on a day like this.
Waste of God’s own sunshine to coop yourself up with a
book. I shall turn you and Francie out on the moor the
minute lunch is over.”</p>

<p>“Francie has a headache,” said Rosamund, with the quick,
defensive gleam in her eyes that her guardian’s cavalier
treatment of Frances’ numerous minor ailments always
roused.</p>

<p>“She won’t get rid of it by sitting indoors,” returned
Bertha decisively.</p>

<p>“Morris, you’ll stay to lunch, will you?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, rather naïvely surprised. Mrs.
Tregaskis had not been prodigal of invitations recently. A
vista of the moorland sweep and Rosamund opened before
him, only to be blotted out by the voice of Mrs. Tregaskis,
its native ring of good-humoured decision somehow emphasized:</p>

<p>“You and I will have a little ploy of our own, Morris,
when I’ve driven my lazybones out to take some exercise. I
want a chat with you.”</p>

<p>She nodded, with her implacable kindliness, and asked
where Frances was.</p>

<p>“In her room,” said Rosamund rather sullenly. “She
is lying down.”</p>

<p>“Lying down at twelve o’clock in the morning!—and on
a day like this,” added Bertha, with another reproachful
glance at the cracked, baking ground and still sunlight outside.
“Is her head very bad?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I must go and investigate. I expect she needs one of
my special compresses of eau de Cologne and cold water.
Well, well!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>She began to mount the stairs slowly, making no attempt
to disguise that her walk had slightly tired her.</p>

<p>“Stairs are no joke, at my age,” she panted laughingly
over her shoulder to Morris; “<i>and</i> with my figure. I be
growin’ a bit broad-like across, ma dear!”</p>

<p>Morris laughed, and watched her disappear up the first
short flight of stairs. He turned to Rosamund rather shyly.
Shyness was not at all inherent in Morris Severing, but the
advent of Mrs. Tregaskis and her few crisp, kindly sentences,
had somehow cut across the atmosphere of joyous
security in which he had met Rosamund that morning.</p>

<p>As he turned to her, Bertha’s broad face, reddened by heat
and exertion, appeared over the balusters.</p>

<p>“Rosamund, my dear, come up here a minute, will you?”</p>

<p>Rosamund gave Morris a look in which appeal and
defiance seemed oddly to mingle, and in her turn disappeared.</p>

<p>Morris Severing was left disconsolate in the hall. It
was of no amusement to him, although he gave the purely
perfunctory laugh of civility, when Miss Blandflower,
hovering on the threshold of the porch, said to him with a
nervous laugh:</p>

<p>“Monarch of all you survey, I see.”</p>

<p>“Have you been gardening?” he inquired with polite superfluity,
at the same time relieving her of an earth-encrusted
trowel and a basket overflowing with plantain and dandelion
roots.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she giggled. “Those <i>norrible</i> weeds!
There’s no rest for the wicked.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not wicked at all, Miss Blandflower,” he
assured her gravely. “Only too good, to tire yourself like
this. Come and rest in the hall.”</p>

<p>Minnie looked doubtful.</p>

<p>She compromised by hovering restlessly between the hall-door
and the window, thereby keeping Morris on his feet,
while she gazed longingly at the sofa, set under the cool of
a huge stand of white daisies and geraniums.</p>

<p>“Very hot,” she sighed, passing an earthy hand over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
heated face. “Well, if you won’t think me too fearfully
lazy——”</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower was always protesting feebly against
accusations that no sane mind could ever have entertained
against her.</p>

<p>“Of course not. I should be much happier if you’d only
sit down till lunch,” said Morris with truth. The exhausted
Minnie sank down thankfully, murmuring “A <i>so</i>-fia is
always a luxury, isn’t it,” and the next moment bounding
agitatedly to her feet as the gong reverberated through the
hall, and Frederick Tregaskis was heard emerging from the
study.</p>

<p>Minnie looked at her large earthy hands with an expression
of horror, muttered something about would these little
hands never be clean, and fled.</p>

<p>It was with a sense almost of fatality, as though such a
thing must inevitably happen where Miss Blandflower was
concerned, that Morris watched, without having time to
prevent it, a collision between her and her host at the foot of
the stairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Tregaskis,” shrieked Minnie, “I beg your pardon—I’d
no idea—<i>so</i> stupid of me.”</p>

<p>“Do not apologize,” said Frederick, in tones of ice and
casting a look of concentrated venom at the overwhelmed
Miss Blandflower. “And pray do not be late for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been gardening,” she gasped, displaying the trophies
of toil in unattractively blackened finger-nails and hardened
palms.</p>

<p>“So I perceive. I believe the gong has sounded?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes. I feel I’ve earned my lunch,” cried Minnie,
disappearing as fast as she could.</p>

<p>“My wife’s protégé,” remarked Frederick, as usual carefully
disassociating himself from his spouse, “has, to my
certain knowledge, made that remark before every meal for
the past fourteen years.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s a very true one, sir,” said Morris with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
what he supposed to be a ready courtesy, and only the expression
of rather sardonic amusement which his host disconcertingly
turned upon him at intervals throughout the
meal, betrayed to Morris that his ready adaptability had led
him to make an almost too apropos rejoinder to Frederick
Tregaskis’ peculiar form of pleasantry.</p>

<p>Morris sat between Hazel and her mother, and was able
to look at Rosamund on the opposite side of the table. She
hardly once raised her eyes to his, but when she did so, he
saw a light in them that brought an answering ardour to his
own gaze.</p>

<p>He had hardly a glance to spare for Hazel Tregaskis,
whose tawny hair seemed to radiate sparkles, even as her
charming personality radiated vitality. Frances, beside her,
looked pale and languid, with dark circles round her eyes,
and as soon as luncheon was over Morris heard Mrs. Tregaskis
say to her affectionately:</p>

<p>“You’d better go upstairs to the boudoir, Francie, and
curl up on the sofa. I’ll come up in a minute and see if we
can’t find something for the poor head.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Cousin Bertie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis looked round, almost like a general arranging
for the dispersal of a superfluous staff.</p>

<p>“Hazel, on with the hat again! I’m not going to have
you dashing out in this sun with nothing on your head. I
suppose you and Minnie want to go up to the moors? and
you must take this lazy child with you.”</p>

<p>She laid a possessive hand upon Rosamund’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Tregaskis, there’s that tiny <i>wee</i> little patch
down by the pond that I meant to finish this afternoon,”
breathed Miss Blandflower, evidently uncertain whether she
was supposed to be pining for moorland air, or eager to
finish her weeding.</p>

<p>“No, no, Minnie.” Mrs. Tregaskis’ tone left no further
room for doubt upon the point. “You did far too much
this morning. You know I’m always telling you not to
choose the very hottest time of day for weeding. I dare say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Morris and I will turn our energies to that patch by the pond,
and surprise you when you get in. Now then, off with
you!”</p>

<p>“But am I not to go to the moors too?” demanded Morris,
half amused and half vexed, and wholly desirous of an
afternoon in Rosamund’s company.</p>

<p>Bertha appeared to consider.</p>

<p>“How would it be if we took up tea to them, later?” she
said, with an air of suggestion. “That’s what we’ll do, and
you can help me to carry the tea-basket. I dare say Francie
will be able to come with us by that time, poor child. It
will be cooler for her.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, you dear people. We shall meet again later—under
the wych-elm, Minnie, you know. Four o’clock.”</p>

<p>Morris dashed out and opened the gate for them.</p>

<p>“You’ll walk back with me,” he said hurriedly to Rosamund,
and read her answer in her eyes, before turning back
with discontent in his own, to where Bertha Tregaskis
awaited him.</p>

<p>She surveyed him with unabashed gaze.</p>

<p>“Well, you think I’m an interfering, tiresome old spoilsport,
don’t you, Morris? But I really must have a talk
with you, and I don’t feel you’re going to be very angry with
me, somehow. After all, we’re <i>very</i> old friends.”</p>

<p>She laughed at him with a sort of friendly pleading in
her look, and Morris laughed a little too. He had always
liked his mother’s friend.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down in the shade, and leave the weeding till it’s
cooler. And now, my dear boy, I’m going straight to the
point. I always face up to my fences boldly—at least I
used to, in the good old days when Frederick could afford
to keep a couple of gees in the stables. You mustn’t make
love to my little girl.”</p>

<p>Morris, to his fury, felt himself colouring hotly. He
could not think what to say.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Bertie, carefully looking away from him,
“it isn’t as though you were both of you a few years older.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
You’ve neither of you seen anything of the world, and Rosamund
is in some ways very undeveloped and young for her
age. I don’t want either of you to take this attraction seriously—at
any rate for the present.”</p>

<p>“Has my mother been talking to you?” demanded Morris
rather sullenly.</p>

<p>Bertha hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“She’s only said what I felt quite sure of already—that
she thinks you too young to entertain any idea of—marriage,
for instance.”</p>

<p>She looked at him narrowly as she spoke, and Morris
coloured again.</p>

<p>“Of course, I couldn’t think of that, exactly,” he stammered
naïvely. “You know quite well that, owing to my
father’s preposterous will, I haven’t anything but what she
gives me.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, my dear boy, though you and I both know very
well that she only holds the whole thing in trust for you,
as it were.”</p>

<p>“Rotten arrangement, I call it,” muttered Morris. “Of
course, I practically do all the business that old Bartlett used
to do for the estate, but it’s a bore being tied here and never
my own master. I should have been in Germany studying
music for the last four years if mother hadn’t made such a
frightful fuss at the idea.”</p>

<p>“I wish you and she understood one another better,”
sighed Bertha. “My sympathies are always on the young
people’s side, you know, Morris, though your mother <i>is</i> my
greatest friend.”</p>

<p>“Really?” he said eagerly. “Then I wish you’d talk
to her a bit.”</p>

<p>“But, Morris, what could I say? I can’t let Rosamund
drift into a sort of half-and-half engagement, you know.
It isn’t fair to her, and I am responsible for her just as
though she were my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Why should it be ‘half-and-half’?” he asked rather
defiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Because she’s too young, and has seen too little of the
world, for me to sanction anything else at present,” said
Bertha decisively.</p>

<p>Morris was slightly soothed by the fact that she laid all
the emphasis on Rosamund’s youth, and not on his own, as
he felt his mother would have done.</p>

<p>“Look here, Morris,” said Bertha earnestly. “I’m asking
you for Rosamund’s sake to have a little patience. If
this is the real thing, it won’t do you any harm to wait for a
year or two, or her either. It’ll help you to know one another
better, too. Why, you’ve not seen her since you were
both children, except for this last week.”</p>

<p>“I <i>knew</i> the first minute I saw her again,” cried Morris
eagerly and boyishly.</p>

<p>“I know she’s very attractive,” said Bertha, smiling rather
proudly, “though I says it as shouldn’t, since she’s just like
my own daughter. You know I’ve had them since their
mother died, Morris.”</p>

<p>“I know,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, then, don’t you think I’ve got just a little right to
be consulted?” She looked at him so humorously that
Morris laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I expect I’d want to consult you, anyway,
on my own account, you know. You do so understand
about things, Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>“You dear boy! That’s just the very nicest thing you
could have said to me. I love young people, and it’s always
been a disappointment to me that I didn’t have ten children.
You see. I had to adopt two as it was! Rosamund is a dear
child, Morris, and I’ve loved her as much as though she were
my own.”</p>

<p>She suddenly sighed, and some unexplained instinct made
Morris exclaim rather defensively:</p>

<p>“And of course she adores you. I’m sure of that.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, my dear boy, one doesn’t expect very much.
The thing I care most about is that they should be good and
happy and keep well. Which reminds me that I must go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and see after my poor little invalid. But, Morris, I do want
to ask you one thing, if you’ll remember that I’m an old
woman and not get angry with me.”</p>

<p>She paused a minute and he cried eagerly:</p>

<p>“Of course, you can ask anything you like. You know
that.”</p>

<p>“I really believe I can, you’re so reasonable. Well,
Morris, I don’t want to know what’s passed between you and
Rosamund, though I rather fancy that little <i>tableau vivant</i>
that I came across in the hall this morning wasn’t strictly
within the rules, but I do ask you not to let things go any
further for the present. Rosamund is going up to Scotland
with me in ten days’ time, which will make things easier, but
I want you to show a man’s self-control and see less of her
than you have been doing lately.”</p>

<p>Morris looked his consternation.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go away altogether, if that is the only
way, and come back again after we’re safe out of the way?”</p>

<p>She did not give him time to reply, but rose, and began
walking back to the house.</p>

<p>“Think it over, while I’m seeing after Frances, and we
can finish our talk when I come back.”</p>

<p>“But look here”—Morris, colouring deeply, had caught
up with her in one or two long strides—“it sounds a most
rotten thing to ask—but—but what will Rosamund think?
She—she must know perfectly well that—that——” He
began to stammer helplessly, and Bertha’s level tones came
with cheery common sense to his rescue.</p>

<p>“My dear boy, Rosamund is a very pretty girl who has
been out a year and a half, and has met with quite a reasonable
amount of admiration. She is much too sensible to
take things seriously until they really become so.” She
hastily dismissed from her recollection certain of the strictures
recently passed upon Rosamund in conversation with
Nina Severing.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I’m in earnest, then?” demanded
Morris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Bertha looked at his flushed, youthful face, ardent with
indignation.</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure that you are,” she said quietly, “and it
depends on you not to let Rosamund become so, or at any
rate think herself so. I am going to trust her to your honour,
Morris.”</p>

<p>On this lofty note she left him, going into the house with
a certain rapidity of step that might have suggested some
anxiety not to spoil a good exit.</p>

<p>But Morris was a great deal too much absorbed in his own
reflections to draw any such conclusions.</p>

<p>He paced up and down the front of the house, his hands
in his pockets.</p>

<p>He did not analyze his sensations, and so escaped the
humiliating knowledge that his principal emotion was one
of satisfaction at Bertha’s admirable understanding. He
wished that his mother could have heard her.</p>

<p>The wish, however, was a subconscious one—his main
preoccupation was with the approaching interview. That
there would be an interview between himself and Rosamund
he took for granted. They would walk back from the moor
together that very afternoon, and he would have to tell her
that he was going away.</p>

<p>Morris thought of her brilliant, ardent gaze and clinging
hands, and kicked the gravel about fiercely.</p>

<p>“Why can’t I be my own master,” he thought angrily.</p>

<p>Unwittingly the thought intruded itself that were he his
own master, he should not make use of that independence to
curtail it by the decisive step of marriage at the age of
twenty-three.</p>

<p>“Damn,” muttered Morris. “Why aren’t things different
all round?”</p>

<p>The desirability of a society where love-making should
be smiled upon by parents and guardians with no ulterior
thoughts of an announcement in the <i>Morning Post</i> to the
effect that a marriage had been arranged, had had time to
impress itself forcibly upon Morris before Mrs. Tregaskis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
rejoined him. She looked troubled, and Morris, attributing
her expression to anxiety on his behalf, remarked with more
than a touch of magnanimity:</p>

<p>“Look here, it seems to me that things work out this way,
more or less. I’d better say good-bye to her this evening,
and go off yachting somewhere. And then by the time I get
back I suppose she’ll be in Scotland.”</p>

<p>Bertha’s brow cleared a little as she looked at him.</p>

<p>“Shake hands, Morris,” she said quietly. “You’re a
white man.”</p>

<p>“You know, I shan’t leave off caring about her,” he said
wistfully. “I shall never love anyone else.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, in two or three years’ time there’ll be
absolutely no objection to you telling her so. And there’s
nobody I should be gladder to give her to. But I do think
that for the present this is the only way.”</p>

<p>Her words woke in Morris a fleeting recollection of Sidney
Carton, and the realization of his own self-abnegation
almost overcame him.</p>

<p>“Let me take that tea-basket,” he muttered hastily.
“Isn’t Frances coming?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. I’ve sent her to bed altogether. To
tell you the truth, Morris, I’m a good deal worried about her,
and if she’s no better this evening I shall ask you to call at
Dr. Lee’s on your way to Pensevern, and send him up here.
She’s got a temperature—though, of course, that doesn’t
mean much with her.”</p>

<p>“Is she so delicate?”</p>

<p>“She’s much stronger than she was when I first had her,”
said Bertha decidedly. “But if she’s not better next week I
certainly shan’t leave her. The other two will have to pay
their visits alone. Poor Francie! She’ll be miserable at
my not having the change, but I couldn’t leave her.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully good,” murmured the boy.</p>

<p>She laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“I’m only an old hen fussing over her brood. It’s all in
the day’s work, Morris, and if it does mean giving up time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
here, and some little pleasure or comfort there, one doesn’t
think twice about it. But don’t let’s talk about me. Fat old
bodies of my age,” said Bertha, striding vigorously across
the garden, “aren’t at all interesting. I consider myself as
dull as ditchwater, and of no earthly use except to give you
young things a helping hand now and again.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re the most understanding person in the
whole world,” said Morris with conviction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE picnic up on the moor, regarded as an al fresco
entertainment, was not a success.</p>

<p>Rosamund’s brow grew dark from the instant
when she demanded, rather than inquired, of her guardian:
“Where is Francie?” and received the placid reply that
Cousin Bertie had thought Frances would be more comfy
tucked up on her bed.</p>

<p>“And you are not going near her till to-night, my dear
little girl,” she added, with a touch of genial severity.
“She’ll do much better without you.”</p>

<p>Bertie exchanged a laughing glance of amusement at her
own hard-heartedness with Miss Blandflower, and Morris
saw Rosamund flush the angry scarlet of a sensitive child
that thinks itself unjustly treated.</p>

<p>She sulked frankly for the rest of the time, and only the
prettiness of the defiant mouth and chin which was all that
Morris could see under her big shady hat prevented him
from feeling provoked with her.</p>

<p>He and Hazel kept up a cheerfully desultory conversation,
while Miss Blandflower pressed unwanted attentions upon
her hostess and fellow-guests.</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I pass you a rock-cake, Mrs. Tregaskis?” she
pleaded. “Some bread-and-butter then? You’re not eating
anything!”</p>

<p>“I be doin’ nicely, thank’ee, ma dear. What’ll yū be
takin’? Crame?”</p>

<p>“No—no, thank you—not for me. Nothing more at
all,” distractedly said Minnie, who had been nibbling at a
small piece of bread-and-butter in the intervals of her activities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Oh, but you must have a jam sandwich,” cried Morris
with the pseudo-heartiness characteristic of such occasions.</p>

<p>“Well—if you won’t all think me fearfully, fearfully
greedy——”</p>

<p>Minnie hesitated and looked wildly round her, but as
no one appeared in the least aghast at the prospect of her
depredations among the jam sandwiches, she deprecatingly
took the smallest one, murmuring, “Thank you muchly—this
is fearful gluttony—‘just one more crust,’ as the boy
said on the burning deck.”</p>

<p>The spasmodic conversation died away.</p>

<p>Presently Hazel said:</p>

<p>“I’ve found the place where we got that white heather last
year, mother. There are some more roots there, if you
want to take them home for the rock garden.”</p>

<p>“Come on and let’s dig then,” said Bertha vigorously,
rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>Morris shot Hazel a glance of gratitude.</p>

<p>He longed to be alone with Rosamund, even while thinking
that he was dreading the pain of bidding her good-bye.</p>

<p>He looked at Miss Blandflower, but Hazel Tregaskis was
quicker than he.</p>

<p>“I shan’t find the way without you,” she declared lightly.</p>

<p>“Come on, Minnie,” shouted Mrs. Tregaskis, already
well on ahead.</p>

<p>“There’s no rest for the wicked,” said Minnie mechanically,
and went.</p>

<p>Rosamund’s first words were not at all what Morris had
expected. She looked at him sombrely, and remarked almost
violently:</p>

<p>“Do you know what’s the matter with Frances? Is
Cousin Bertie really frightened about her?”</p>

<p>“No, not seriously, I don’t think,” he answered, instinctively
anxious to soothe her. “She only said that if Frances
wasn’t quite well again next week she wouldn’t go to
Scotland, but would send you and Hazel alone.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t go if Francie is ill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>He looked at her, astounded.</p>

<p>“But, Rosamund, what’s the matter? She isn’t ill. Mrs.
Tregaskis herself said that a temperature didn’t mean anything
at all with Frances.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t understand,” she burst out angrily.
“Nobody understands in the least what Frances is to me.
Cousin Bertie has never understood, and never will. You
heard what she said just now.”</p>

<p>He had forgotten.</p>

<p>“That I’m not to go near Frances till to-night. She
always treats me like a child.”</p>

<p>She looked very like one indeed, as she spoke, flushed and
indignant.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Frances was going to sleep, and doesn’t want to
be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“As though <i>I</i> should disturb her! Why, I’ve looked after
her ever since she was a little girl—until we came to live
here. <i>Now</i>,” said Rosamund bitterly, “I’m told to mind my
own business and let Frances mind hers.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Morris. “Don’t let’s talk about
it. I want to tell you something, Rosamund.”</p>

<p>Her angry face softened a little, but she seemed unable
to dismiss the subject.</p>

<p>“Nobody has ever understood about Frances and me—ever.
I feel more as though she were my child than my
sister.”</p>

<p>Morris was becoming heartily tired of the discussion, and
showed distinct traces of that fatigue in his tone, as he replied
perfunctorily:</p>

<p>“Of course I understand—but, really, she’s only three
years younger than you are, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie is always harping on that, and telling
Frances not to be domineered over!”</p>

<p>“Rosamund!” cried Morris, “you really talk as though
Mrs. Tregaskis was always being unkind to you. I can’t
understand you. Why, she simply adores you both—just
as though she were your mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>He was totally unable to understand why Rosamund, at
this, turned the fury of her eyes full upon him.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, any more than anyone else.”</p>

<p>“Don’t understand <i>what</i>?” almost shouted Morris. “I
don’t understand you, when you talk like that.”</p>

<p>Nor did he. She seemed to him altogether unbalanced,
and as different as possible from the stately, wonderful
Rosamund whom he had met in the orchard at Porthlew.</p>

<p>“Why do you speak as though Mrs. Tregaskis was unkind,
or unsympathetic?” he asked more gently. “She is
devoted to you. You can’t think how proud she is of you,
Rosamund.”</p>

<p>“I’m not her daughter.”</p>

<p>“She <i>feels</i> as though you were. She told me so herself.”</p>

<p>“I wish you hadn’t let her talk to you about me at all,”
said Rosamund unhappily.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’d say that if you knew how nice and
understanding she was. I—I wish I could explain better.”</p>

<p>Morris felt the impotence of his lame and stammering
words before the deep hostility, which he recognized, although
he was at a loss to account for it, in Rosamund’s
silence.</p>

<p>“I haven’t ever told anyone,” she said at last, stammering
a little, “but I’ve always resented being told that Cousin
Bertha has done everything for us and is so fond of us. Of
course it’s quite true in a way, but she’s never made me
happy—or Francie either.”</p>

<p>If Morris thought that the fault lay more on Rosamund’s
side than on her guardian’s, he would not say so, but his
too expressive face betrayed him to Rosamund’s quick perceptions.</p>

<p>“You think I’m ungrateful—but I do recognize all the
material things she’s done for us.”</p>

<p>Morris thought her explanation very ungracious, and then
chid himself half-heartedly for criticizing his goddess.</p>

<p>“She’s done more than material things, hasn’t she?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
reminded her gently. “It’s not as though Porthlew had
been an alien atmosphere. She cares about all the things
that matter—books and music and friendship and other
things too. That’s what makes her so wonderful, I think—that
she should have that side to her, as well as the splendid
practical capable side that everyone can see and admire.”</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at him, with a face that seemed to have
grown weary.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” she said slowly.</p>

<p>Morris felt, unreasonably, as though he had been weighed
and found wanting, in the balance of that baffled, tired gaze
of hers. He reflected with bewilderment that although she
had looked at him like a child when she had spoken defiantly
and angrily of her guardian, she now looked very much
older, and more unhappy.</p>

<p>“What is it, Rosamund?” he asked, half involuntarily,
and conscious of the futility of the question.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” she said drearily.</p>

<p>It was the discontented child again.</p>

<p>Morris remained silent, plucking at the tough strands of
heather all round him.</p>

<p>He felt injured.</p>

<p>He had come out on the moor prepared to sacrifice himself,
to bid Rosamund a long farewell, and to take away
with him only the memory of that bitter-sweet parting hour.
Surely the intuition of love should have met him more than
halfway. But Rosamund, with childish perversity, had
harped upon the string of her own grievances, grievances
which Morris could not but feel to be for the most part
imaginary ones. She was not thinking about him at all, and
all his wealth of love and self-sacrifice had gone unheeded.
Morris began to feel angry, and, worse still, as though he
were being made a fool of in his own eyes.</p>

<p>It did not calm him to reflect that he would probably
appear in exactly the same light to the penetrating gaze of
Bertha Tregaskis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>She was even now advancing slowly towards them, stooping
every now and then to prod at some little root or plant
and pull it up into her capacious basket.</p>

<p>Morris got up abruptly.</p>

<p>“Rosamund, do you know that I’m going away?”</p>

<p>She looked almost as much startled as he could have
wished.</p>

<p>“When, Morris? Where?”</p>

<p>“At once,” he said gloomily. “I don’t know where—or
care.”</p>

<p>He had meant to ask her if she would “wait for him”
in the time-honoured phrase, but he had not reckoned on
having to cram the whole parting scene, as it were, into the
last three minutes of his interview.</p>

<p>Rosamund also looked at Bertha’s advancing form and
spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you meant to go away, Morris.”</p>

<p>Was her voice trembling a little?</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” he cried passionately.</p>

<p>Bertha hailed them with a prolonged “coo-ee” that might
have been regarded as superfluous in view of the fact that
only some rapidly diminishing hundred yards now lay between
them.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” repeated Morris earnestly, and was unable
to resist adding, “but—it’s the only way.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He also made use of that excellent phrase, for which he
was beholden to Mrs. Tregaskis, in conversation with his
mother that evening.</p>

<p>It was more than wasted upon her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean by ‘the only way,’” she
returned with a sudden irritating assumption of common
sense, her lack of which she habitually dwelt upon with
pensive complacency.</p>

<p>“If you want to go yachting, Morris, well and good; but
don’t talk in an affected melodramatic style, as though you
were making some great sacrifice in going, please. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
doesn’t ring true, and you know how I hate little insincerities.”</p>

<p>Nina’s assault was perhaps not utterly unprovoked. A
certain jutting forward of her son’s jaw, a tendency to monosyllabic
replies preceded by the slight start of one roused
from a profound reverie, had conveyed to Nina all too accurately
that Morris was enacting, in his own opinion, the rôle
of <i>jeune premier</i> in a drama of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>“I’ve already told you that you can start on this yachting
trip whenever you please, so why talk as though it were some
tremendous decision which you had just come to?” she demanded
irritably.</p>

<p>Morris smiled with a superior expression.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, mother,” he told her, with a
touch of compassion.</p>

<p>Few remarks were more calculated to rouse her annoyance.</p>

<p>“My dear boy, it’s perfectly childish to talk like that.
How can there be anything about <i>you</i> which <i>I</i>, your mother,
can’t understand? It makes one realize how very very
young you are, when you talk like that.”</p>

<p>But even allusions to his youth could not disturb Morris’s
exalted mood.</p>

<p>He was unable to resist giving his mother a hint of the
heights to which he had attained.</p>

<p>“I was up at Porthlew this afternoon,” he said in a meaning
tone.</p>

<p>“So I supposed. You always come back in this silly, self-satisfied
frame of mind when you’ve been with those girls,
who naturally play up to your vanity. If that’s the effect
of the Grantham girl’s influence, Morris, the less you see of
her the better, for your own sake.”</p>

<p>The fatal word “influence,” combined with the preposterous
implication that Nina had slightingly forgotten Miss
Grantham’s very name, roused Morris to anger at last.</p>

<p>“Rosamund Grantham and I have said good-bye, mother.
It was the only way. Some day I shall come back to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and find her waiting,” said Morris, considerably worked up
by the pathos of his own eloquence, and momentarily forgetful
that he had received no such pledge. “But you make it
impossible that I should tell you anything of what I am going
through, when you speak as you did just now.”</p>

<p>He walked with sorrowful dignity to the door, confident
that his mother would not allow him to leave the room without
giving him further opportunities for rhetoric.</p>

<p>Nina, in effect, finding herself driven to her last resort,
with a readiness born of much experience, began gently to
cry.</p>

<p>“Darling, you know I didn’t mean it if I spoke impatiently.
I only want to sympathize with you and comfort you.”</p>

<p>He turned slowly towards her.</p>

<p>She was deeply relieved that the <i>affaire</i> Rosamund should
have been successfully tided over. Morris was far from
being as heartbroken at the idea of parting from his love as
he had been before their final interview, and the evening
passed amid a harmonious rendering of a strong man’s grief
and his mother’s tender sympathy.</p>

<p>Preparations for his journey absorbed Morris for the next
twenty-four hours, during which he and his mother enjoyed
the sense of perfect companionship which was always theirs
on the rare occasions when their respective mental <i>tableaux
vivants</i> of one another happened to coincide, and then he
was off.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my darling boy. Enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mother dear. Write to me and”—his voice
took on the slightly deeper note consecrated to the strong-man-in-grief
attitude—“tell me any news of <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest, of course,” tenderly replied Nina, but she
refrained from telling him the only piece of news which
transpired during the next few days: that Frances was not
well enough for Mrs. Tregaskis to leave her, and that Rosamund
had refused to accompany Hazel to Scotland, but remained
with her guardian at Porthlew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“It <i>is</i> tiresome of her,” said Bertha, in a tone more nearly
resembling annoyance than she often used.</p>

<p>“Frances isn’t seriously ill at all, and if she were Rosamund
would be the worst possible person for her. She
goes about looking like a tragedy-queen, as though Frances
were at death’s door.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth did you let her stay?” said Nina with
more derision than sympathy in her voice.</p>

<p>“She asked Frederick. You know how tiresome and
contradictory he can be, and of course he knew perfectly
well that I didn’t want Rosamund fussing and fretting on my
hands, but he said she could do as she liked. He always
takes up an absurd attitude of having no authority over
those two, as you know.”</p>

<p>“I know. So Hazel has gone alone?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had to send my maid with her, though I should have
done that in any case. I don’t approve of young girls travelling
about all over the country by themselves.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for you that you have girls who can be chaperoned!
Look at poor little me—I can’t run after Morris, let
alone send a maid with him, and have to sit here with a
trembling heart, wondering all the time how things are going
with him.”</p>

<p>“That’s always the way with a son, my dear, or a husband
either,” said Bertha, determinedly emphasizing the
fact that she, although not the mother of a son, also possessed
a male appendage.</p>

<p>“It’s our part just to sit at home and work and wait,
while they have all the fun,” Nina sighed. “A woman’s
life is one long self-sacrifice,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“It is, when one has to mend and make and nurse, and
all the rest of it,” cordially agreed Bertha, with one fleeting
glance at Nina’s exquisite, empty hands, folded in her
lap.</p>

<p>The glance was not lost upon Mrs. Severing, who presently
said reflectively that Mr. Bartlett would no doubt call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
upon her shortly with some of his interminable business
questions, and she must ask dearest Bertie to forgive her.
It was not her way to put off a matter of business.</p>

<p>“Unpractical, dreamy creature that I am,” said Nina with
a sad, sweet smile, “I have had too many years’ hard training
in looking after this big estate, ever to be unbusinesslike.
Mr. Bartlett always amuses me so much when he <i>will</i> say
that I should make a better agent than he does.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder!” exclaimed Bertha, the dryness of her
tone making it abundantly evident that her emphatic assent
was directed towards Nina’s amusement, and not towards
Mr. Bartlett’s opinion of his employer’s abilities. “No, no,
dear. You must stick to your charming songs. They’re
<i>your</i> work in the world,” smiled Bertha tolerantly.</p>

<p>“Dear Bertie! How sweet of you to say so. I’m always
afraid of being just some silly, trivial flowery thing—not
of any real use in the world.”</p>

<p>“The world needs its little speedwell flowers just as much
as its sturdy oak-trees,” laughed Bertha tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Nina deftly. “There is room for Mary
as well as for Martha. It always comforts me to remember
that.”</p>

<p>Comfort, however, was not the predominant expression on
the face of Mrs. Tregaskis as she heard her friend’s favourite
Scriptural parallel once more enunciated.</p>

<p>“If you’re really waiting for Mr. Bartlett, darling, I
mustn’t keep you,” she said rather hastily. “Anyhow, I
must get back to my invalid. She’s much better to-day, and
only fretting at the idea of my having missed the Scotch
visits. Of course one <i>had</i> been rather longing for a breath
of Scottish air, this weather, but I dare say I shall manage
without. It’s an economy, at all events.”</p>

<p>She gave her cheery, plucky laugh.</p>

<p>“How is Morris enjoying Norway? Has he got over
his love-lornity?”</p>

<p>Nina laughed a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“I think he has. I’ve had a very cheery letter from him,
raving about the fiords and things.”</p>

<p>Bertha looked slightly puzzled.</p>

<p>“The——? Oh, you mean the <i>fjords</i>! Yes, of course
they must be perfectly gorgeous at this time of year,” she
remarked thoughtfully, with the air of a connoisseuse.</p>

<p>“They are just the same at any time of year, dear,”
sweetly returned Nina. “Geoffrey and I went there for a
fortnight once—it seems oh so long ago! It somehow
made one think of those far-away days when everything was
couleur de rose——”</p>

<p>There were few topics that Bertha enjoyed less than the
retrospective couleur de rose of her friend’s married life,
and she hastily dragged the conversation back into the
living present.</p>

<p>“I’m so very glad about Morris. Give the boy my love
when you write. I wish Rosamund was half as sensible as
he is. She goes mooning about the place as though she’d
lost her dearest friend.”</p>

<p>Bertha gave a slightly apologetic laugh at her own
acerbity, and Nina, whose regard for Rosamund always
waxed in proportion as her friend’s waned, murmured with
the air of a compassionate angel:</p>

<p>“Poor child! One remembers the heartaches of one’s
own youth. The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts,
Bertie!”</p>

<p>“Well, Morris appears to have curtailed his successfully
enough, at all events,” crisply returned Bertha. “I always
said there was stuff in the boy, Nina, although you’ve spoilt
him so outrageously.”</p>

<p>Nina laughed, and kissed Mrs. Tregaskis affectionately as
they said good-bye.</p>

<p>It always pleased her to be told that she spoilt Morris.
She had consistently over-indulged him as a little boy, and
did so still in all matters where his personal pleasures were
concerned, provided that they did not interfere with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
wishes. The accusation of spoiling seemed to add colour to
her frequently-voiced conviction that youth was very hard,
and that a mother’s sacrifices often went unheeded.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I <i>have</i> spoilt him,” she sighed in response
to Bertha’s words. “But after all, Morris has been my only
thought for so many, many years....”</p>

<p>Bertha told herself that really poor Nina was sometimes
positively maudlin, and firmly created a diversion by demanding
the loan of Nina’s seldom-used garden scissors.</p>

<p>“At all events,” she told herself, as she walked briskly
away, “I managed to forestall an allusion, for once, to poor
Geoffrey. And now for my little tragedy-queen!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But Rosamund, though not undeserving of her guardian’s
epithet, gave less trouble than Bertha had anticipated. With
characteristic want of balance, she was absorbed in one
thought only: that of her sister. As long as Frances remained
ill, Rosamund gave little thought to Morris Severing.
Perhaps the measure of her undeveloped lack of proportion
might have been probed by that fact. The memory of a
spoilt illusion might come to vex and grieve the youthfulness
of her spirit later, but that would only be when the
nearer, and to her infinitely more real, solicitude had ceased
to be.</p>

<p>And Rosamund, her outlook being honest, knew, and was
to know more clearly yet, that her first love had brought her
no nearer to that reality which lies at the back of all wisdom,
and which for her was still typified by her love for Frances.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“ROSAMUND!” wrote Hazel from the North.
“The most marvellous things in all the world are
happening. I am in love—with a man who wears
an eyeglass—(you know how I’ve always hated an eyeglass)
and he is in love with me. He is Sir Guy Marleswood,
and he’s thirty-four, and <i>quite</i> six foot, and I don’t
think I should mind if he were five foot nothing. I <i>know</i> I
shouldn’t. I’ve known him a fortnight, and yet we both
feel as though we’d known each other all our lives, and yet
it’s new and wonderful all the time. It’s indescribable.
There’s one thing—which <i>I</i> have to keep reminding myself
of, but which will assume enormous proportions as soon as
one begins to do anything—I mean, write to mother, or
wear an engagement ring. (He’s given me a most beautiful
one, a ruby marquise, only I won’t wear it.) He’s been married
before, and he had to divorce his wife five years ago.
I knew it before we met, because the girls here had been
talking about him, and said that was why their mother had
not asked him to stay in the house, but he came to the dance,
and he is staying at the Ludleys’, a mile away. That’s
where we met, and I’ve seen him nearly every day since—and
the days when I don’t see him are just <i>hell</i>—only knowing
that Heaven may open again at any minute.</p>

<p>“Rosamund dear, I know now that I was a fool ever to
let boys make love to me or propose in the sort of half-and-half
way that a boy does—asking one to wait for him because
he may have enough to marry on in fifteen years’ time,
and meanwhile exchange photographs and write every Sunday
afternoon. You know the sort of thing—that does to
tell other girls about, and sentimentalize over when a waltz
that you used to dance with <i>him</i> is being played. But when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
it’s the real thing—when a <i>man</i> tells you that he cares for
you and asks you to be his wife—it’s absolutely and utterly
different. Guy asked me the fifth time he saw me. He told
me about his wife first. The odd thing is, that I don’t mind.
Of course I shouldn’t mind about the moral part of it, anyhow—I
mean whom God hath joined together and all that—but
I don’t seem even to mind about his having once loved
her and married her. They only cared for one another a
very little while, and it’s all past and over. The present is
ours—and more glorious and wonderful than any words
can ever say. As for the future—he says he is going to
marry me before the end of the year. And I am to put off
my other visits and come home this week, and then he will
write to daddy, and come down to Cornwall. Of course it
isn’t daddy that counts at all, since I can manage him perfectly,
but I have a sort of an idea that Guy will get exactly
what he wants, even out of mother. He’s the sort of person
that does.</p>

<p>“We haven’t told anybody anything. I haven’t the
slightest doubt that Lady Alistair has guessed, and the girls
too, but even if she writes to mother it’ll only bring things
to a crisis rather sooner. I’m writing to her myself this
evening, so she’ll know by the time you get this.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of anything or anyone in the world.
Guy and I have found one another, and nothing else matters.
Besides, I <i>know</i> he’ll manage everything!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“As ever,</span><br>

“<span class="smcap">Hazel</span>.”</p>
</div>


<p>If Hazel’s letter brought a strange wondering sense of
disquietude to Rosamund, and that not wholly on her
cousin’s account, the much shorter note which she had sent
her mother apparently produced no such effect. Bertha appeared
at luncheon with a brow but slightly corrugated, and
only an added tinge of briskness in her manner to betray
perturbation of spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“I see you’ve had a letter from Hazel by the midday post,
Rosamund,” observed Miss Blandflower in the middle of
luncheon, with a praiseworthy desire to dissipate the slight
atmosphere of constraint which had lately been noticeable at
meals, in spite of the valiant and hearty efforts of Mrs.
Tregaskis. “When does she return to the bosom of her
family?” She gave a slight giggle in lieu of quotation
marks.</p>

<p>Rosamund hesitated, felt her cousin Bertha glance sharply
at her, and answered nervously:</p>

<p>“I’m not sure—soon, I think.”</p>

<p>“She has two more visits to pay,” said Mrs. Tregaskis
coldly. “You knew that, Rosamund.”</p>

<p>Her husband looked up suddenly.</p>

<p>“She’s coming back on Friday. You knew that, Bertha,”
he said mockingly. “I understand that our parental sanction
is required to an engagement of marriage. Very gratifying,
I’m sure, in these emancipated days.”</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower turned startled eyes from one to the
other of Hazel’s parents.</p>

<p>“They say one wedding makes another,” she sighed with
nervous inappositeness. “But is it really—who is it...?”</p>

<p>“My dear Minnie, Hazel is a silly little girl who ought
never to have been allowed to pay visits without a chaperoning
mamma. It serves me right for having relaxed my rule—but
one can’t be in two places at once, and really these
young ladies require such a lot of looking after!”</p>

<p>Bertha sighed gustily.</p>

<p>“One only wonders how you can manage in the marvellous
way you do, with so much upon your hands,” said Minnie,
feeling that this remark, although far from being original,
came at any rate from a safe stock, and might be more
acceptable than further questions.</p>

<p>At all events it steered the conversation into smoother
channels, and no further allusions were made in public to
Hazel’s affairs, until three days later, when Hazel herself
returned to Porthlew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Rosamund was instantly conscious of an indefinable
change in her cousin.</p>

<p>Self-possessed Hazel Tregaskis had always been, but the
youthful security of her manner had somehow deepened into
an impression of inward assurance that held less of self-confidence,
and more of some larger stability, that would not
be easily shaken. When her mother greeted her with matter-of-fact
warmth, and said gaily, “Well, my little girl,
I’m glad to have you under my wing again; I think it’s the
last time we must let you go gallivanting off on your own
for the present,” Rosamund saw that Hazel did not give
the petulant shrug or grimace with which the girl Hazel
would have received such a greeting, but looked at her
mother with a strange, remote look that held something of
an almost impersonal compassion.</p>

<p>It was that same look, Rosamund thought, which angered
Mrs. Tregaskis when her daughter resolutely asked her for
an interview that evening.</p>

<p>“No, my darling; I’m not going to let you stay and chatter
now. You’ve had a long journey, and must pop off to bed
early. We’ll have a long talk to-morrow. Dad and I are
not at all angry with you, but I’ve had a letter from Jessie
Alistair, and it’s quite plain that I ought never to have let
you go and stay away without me. Now run along with
Rosamund, my pet.”</p>

<p>“What did Lady Alistair say?”</p>

<p>“I shall talk to you about that to-morrow. I am not at
all angry with you, Hazel, but one thing you and Rosamund
may as well understand, since I suppose you’ve told her all
about it. You may flirt with boys of your own age, if you
like, and have all the fun that’s natural and proper, but——”
Bertha Tregaskis paused. She spoke with a quiet and good-humoured
implacability, her hands resting on her broad hips,
and her resolute mouth set firmly. “<i>But</i>—to flirt and get
yourself talked about with a married man, is—a—thing—I—don’t—allow.
See, darling?”</p>

<p>Rosamund caught her breath and looked at her cousin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Hazel, who seldom or never blushed, had flushed the slow,
deep crimson of a woman who hears herself insulted.</p>

<p>“Sir Guy Marleswood is not a married man,” she said
slowly. “At least, neither he nor I think so, which is what
matters, after all. He divorced his wife five years ago. He
has asked me to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Very well, darling. When he writes and asks the permission
of your parents, we shall see. But a man of four-
or five-and-thirty, who has led the sort of life that he has
led, does not generally want to marry a little girl of nineteen,
even though he may be dishonourable enough to play
at making love to her.”</p>

<p>But this agreeable theory was shattered next day, when
Sir Guy Marleswood wrote a formal statement of his position,
and an almost equally formal request for his daughter’s
hand in marriage, to Frederick Tregaskis. He also
stated unemphatically that the following day would find him
at Porthlew Railway Hotel.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Rosamund watched the storm break over the
household with a strangely aching heart.</p>

<p>Bertha regarded Sir Guy as a married man, and said so
staunchly. Frederick Tregaskis, whom Rosamund had
never yet heard to agree with his wife, declined to view the
question from an ethical standpoint, but declared Hazel too
young to enter upon a marriage which would of necessity be
regarded more or less dubiously by the world in general.</p>

<p>“Wait another five years,” he remarked grimly to his
daughter, “and see if you can’t do better for yourself than
a divorced baronet fifteen years older than yourself.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Hazel, her small face set like a flint. “He
wants me to marry him now.”</p>

<p>“I dare say. And I want you to wait. I suppose you
owe something to your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, and began to cry. “But not everything
in the world. I owe something to myself. It’s <i>my</i> life.”</p>

<p>It was the passionate cry for individualism that Rosamund
had heard from Morris Severing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>But Hazel Tregaskis, unlike Morris, was directing all the
energies of her will into one channel. And Rosamund,
watching, saw those energies guided and strengthened day
by day by the stronger force that held steadfast behind her.</p>

<p>Guy Marleswood was not of those who fail.</p>

<p>Before the close of that year, the day came when he extorted
from the exasperated Frederick: “Marry her, then.
I see you mean to do it, both of you, and it may as well be
with my consent as without it. Anything to put an end to
the subject.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Sir Guy imperturbably. “I will
go and tell Mrs. Tregaskis that we have your consent to the
marriage.”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the kind. I shall tell her myself.
I may as well get some satisfaction out of it,” said
Frederick viciously.</p>

<p>He sought his wife in the library, where she sat, looking
unusually disheartened, amid a pile of leaflets.</p>

<p>“Bertha, you are about to be relieved of one of your responsibilities.”</p>

<p>“I’m thankful to hear it,” she returned wearily.</p>

<p>“I have decided to give Hazel into Marleswood’s keeping.”</p>

<p>“Frederick! You can’t. You’re mad. A child of nineteen—and
a marriage that’s no marriage—she’ll be no
more married in the eyes of God than if she were openly living
as that man’s mistress.”</p>

<p>“I’m not concerned with the eyes of God,” said her husband
in detached tones. “It’s perfectly evident to mine that
if we don’t give our consent they mean to do without it, and
I don’t choose to have my daughter making a runaway
match. We had better give in gracefully while it is still
possible, Bertha. Marleswood is not the sort of man to heal
a breach, if it came to that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that we don’t want to be cut off from the little
girl for ever after her marriage,” said Frederick, his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
shaking a very little. “That’s what it’ll mean if we let her
go from under our roof in defiance, Bertha.”</p>

<p>“Hazel is an infatuated, self-willed child, but she is not
heartless,” cried Bertha.</p>

<p>“I do not intend to put her to the test.” Frederick
Tregaskis had regained his habitual dryness of utterance.</p>

<p>With unwonted consideration, he added a word of consolation
for his wife.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you that I am perfectly satisfied that
Marleswood is a good fellow in every way, and devoted to
her. The whole thing, after all, amounts to a question of
conscience, which she is entitled to judge for herself.”</p>

<p>“She’s not,” flashed Bertha. “She’s only a child, and
ought to accept the ruling of her parents until she’s old
enough to judge for herself.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” said Frederick drily, “that all parents,
taken as a class, would agree with you. Unfortunately for
ourselves, however, we have passed into an era where the
individual, and not the class, will rule.”</p>

<p>He walked out of the room, looking older and more deeply
lined than ever.</p>

<p>Rosamund found Mrs. Tregaskis, who never broke down,
weeping violently among the piles of disordered pamphlets.</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie! Don’t!” cried Rosamund fearfully.
“Is it about Hazel?”</p>

<p>Bertha raised a piteously mottled and disfigured face.</p>

<p>“I’m beaten,” she cried. “Frederick has consented to
this iniquitous marriage, and nothing can stop it now. My
little girl, whom I’ve brought up to be good, and to whom
I’ve tried to teach religion—that she should be willing to
break my heart, and rush deliberately into sin, the first time
temptation comes near her!”</p>

<p>“No—no. It’s not that. She doesn’t think it’s sin.
She doesn’t believe it’s sin—not for an instant. Her point
of view is different.”</p>

<p>“Her point of view!” cried Bertha bitterly. “How dare
you talk to me, a woman of fifty, of such preposterous nonsense?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
You and she are children; you know nothing of life,
you’ve had no experience. How can Hazel judge of what is
right or wrong? She’s a child—a child.”</p>

<p>In the vehement repetition of the assertion, it seemed to
Rosamund that she found her clue to Bertha Tregaskis’s
impotent suffering. She would not, could not, admit in her
daughter any claim to the rights of an individual.</p>

<p>Hazel’s judgment, unrecognized by her mother, carried
with it no amazement to Rosamund.</p>

<p>Certain faiths, certain scruples and acceptances inborn in
Rosamund and Frances, had been the veriest lip-service to
the child Hazel always. Rosamund recognized in her the
purest and most natural type of highly-evolved paganism.</p>

<p>“You know, Rosamund, I’m not doing anything wrong,
although they won’t believe it. It isn’t wrong <i>to me</i>, and I
don’t believe in an abstract right and wrong. Each individual
case has its own laws.”</p>

<p>“Should you do it if you thought it <i>was</i> wrong?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Hazel thoughtfully. “I can’t imagine
seriously believing that it would matter to God, one
way or the other. Should you? Frances wouldn’t, one
knows.”</p>

<p>“If I did it,” slowly said Rosamund, “it would be as a
deliberate choice between good and evil. I should believe
myself to be breaking God’s law—but I might do it, if I
thought it worth while.”</p>

<p>She knew that if, as she said, it seemed to her worth
while, no laws of God or man should bind her. But she
would break them of deliberate intent, whereas to Hazel
Tregaskis they were non-existent, myths designed for the
wanton frightening of children.</p>

<p>Rosamund recognized the absolute sincerity of Hazel’s
point of view, and sometimes found herself wondering what
Sir Guy’s might be. One day, very soon before the marriage,
she held an odd little conversation with him, standing
in the wintry sunshine of the terrace. Frederick Tregaskis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was ahead of them, grimly poking with a walking-stick at a
little drain that was choked with leaves.</p>

<p>“He’s been very kind to me,” said Sir Guy abruptly, indicating
with a gesture the odd little figure.</p>

<p>“I think that he really likes you very much,” said Rosamund.
“And though he would be very angry at being told
so, I have always known that Cousin Frederick adores
Hazel.”</p>

<p>Sir Guy nodded with full comprehension.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. She knows that, too. It’s been the
best thing in her life so far—that and having you and your
sister here.” He paused for a moment or two. “You
know,” he said slowly, “I want to try and make up to her
for everything that she hasn’t had, so far. She ought to
have everything. She seems, somehow, so made for happiness.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen Hazel sad,” said Rosamund, rather
surprised. “I think she is happy by nature.”</p>

<p>“Yes, though an atmosphere which might perhaps seem
an unsympathetic one——”</p>

<p>He left the sentence unfinished, and it required no effort
on Rosamund’s part to conjecture his meaning. Sir Guy
resented, none the less implacably that his resentment was
expressed by implication only, the attitude of Mrs. Tregaskis
towards her daughter. That Hazel herself had never
resented it, and had only opposed to it the bright glancing
hardness of her impenetrable self-confidence, did not, Rosamund
felt, in any way diminish his perfectly silent ire. Mrs.
Tregaskis herself would be forced to recognize that in this
man fifteen years her senior, Hazel had found champion as
well as lover, knight as well as comrade.</p>

<p>Rosamund turned away with an aching heart, wondering
dimly whether her need had not been greater than Hazel’s.</p>

<p>After the formal consent given by Frederick Tregaskis,
there had been no further discussions between Sir Guy and
Mrs. Tregaskis. She accepted her defeat with the sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
grim gallantry that would always be characteristic of her,
and, as far as Rosamund knew, attempted no appeal to
Hazel. But she aged more perceptibly in the weeks before
Hazel’s marriage than during all the five years that Rosamund
had passed at Porthlew.</p>

<p>No other indication that her guardian recognized defeat
was evident to Rosamund’s eyes. Her manner to her
daughter was what it had always been—kindly, authoritative,
at times possessive. She admitted Sir Guy’s claims
to much of her daughter’s time, and even seemed disposed,
gradually, to concede to him rights which he had not tried
to arrogate for himself.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let this little person be too much in London,”
she observed, with a hand upon Hazel’s shoulder.
“We’re very excitable, and it knocks us up. I had to be a
very strict mamma and bring her home long before the
dances had come to an end last year.”</p>

<p>“If we take the St. James’ Square flat, there is no reason
why we shouldn’t spend all the week-ends Hazel likes at
Marleswood.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about week-ends,” said Bertha
doubtfully. “They’re not very restful. I think a home in
the country and an occasional fling in London must be
Hazel’s programme.”</p>

<p>She spoke with her customary matter-of-fact assurance
and kindly good sense.</p>

<p>Sir Guy fixed his objectionable monocle more firmly.</p>

<p>“That,” he observed in a detached manner, “is a decision
which I shall leave entirely to my wife.”</p>

<p>If Mrs. Tregaskis found it necessary to readjust her
forces after this, the readjustment was made silently and
without delay. But it was very shortly after that, when it
only wanted a week to Hazel’s wedding-day, that Rosamund
again found Cousin Bertha in the library, struggling with
hard, choking sobs. Hazel hung over her, caressing her
with most unwonted demonstrativeness and with tears in her
own pretty eyes. But that they were tears of the merest surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
pity and tenderness was abundantly obvious even without
the gently mournful observation which she made to
Rosamund that evening.</p>

<p>“Poor mother! I hate to see her minding it so, but you
know, Rosamund, I <i>can’t</i> feel as unhappy as I ought.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish—sometimes—that you’d waited, as
they begged you to? It would have been the same for you
in the end.”</p>

<p>“The same for me, and the same for them,” returned
Hazel crisply. “They wouldn’t have liked it any better ten
years hence—at least mother wouldn’t. I believe daddy’s
reconciled already. Mother wants me to be happy, but in
<i>her</i> way.”</p>

<p>“Are you really happy, when you know she is miserable?”
spoke Rosamund with more curiosity than compassion.
Hazel coloured, but faced her cousin with unflinching
honesty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I am. It’s of no use to pretend, Rosamund.
I am happier than I have ever been in my life. Of
course, I should have preferred it if everything had been
straightforward, and there hadn’t been all this fuss, and
having to extort a consent—but it would have been just
the same if they hadn’t given it. Do you know, that’s the
pathos of it, to my mind—they couldn’t do anything. Guy
and I would have married without their consent, just as
much as with it.”</p>

<p>“He asked you to, I suppose,” said Rosamund, as though
stating a fact.</p>

<p>Hazel pushed her curling tawny hair from her forehead.</p>

<p>“He asked me if I would, if it came to that, and of course
I said yes. But we both knew it wouldn’t come to that,
and that mother would have to give in. I used to think that
if one’s parents forbade a thing, it became impossible <i>ipso
facto</i>, but it doesn’t. <i>They just can’t do anything at all.</i>”</p>

<p>To Rosamund, Hazel had summed up the situation in that
sentence.</p>

<p>They could not do anything at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>The wedding took place quietly at Porthlew, and they said
good-bye to Hazel, radiant-eyed, and clinging in an unwonted
embrace to her father at the last moment.</p>

<p>Then she drove away with her husband, and Miss Blandflower,
in a piping soprano, remarked to Rosamund:</p>

<p>“It’s like a death in a house, isn’t it? But we must all
try and take her place, now.”</p>

<p>The suggestion drove Frederick, snarling disgustedly, into
the study.</p>

<p>Frances went quietly to put away some of the litter in
Hazel’s room, while Rosamund, feeling herself useless and
in the way, yet hung helplessly in the vicinity of Nina Severing,
who had remained with Bertha in the drawing-room
after the departure of the few guests.</p>

<p>But no word of Morris reached her.</p>

<p>Nina was murmuring consolation to her friend who, for
once inactive, sat gazing heavily into the fire.</p>

<p>“After all, dearest, the young birds will fly out of the old
nest and leave it desolate. It’s nature.”</p>

<p>Bertha groaned.</p>

<p>“It’s not the selfish loss to myself that I mind, Nina, but
the thing she’s done. If I were giving her to some simple,
honest boy of her own age, how gladly I’d see her go. We
mothers don’t ask more than that, after all—just to see the
children happy.”</p>

<p>“I know,” breathed Mrs. Severing. “It’s all one lives
for.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no plans or wishes for myself—it’s all for them,”
muttered Bertha disjointedly. “What else has one to care
about—an old gargoyle....”</p>

<p>Nina straightened herself slightly.</p>

<p>“‘Having outlived hope, fear, desire....’” she quoted
softly, at the same time turning her long neck so that the firelight
fell upon her burnished hair and exquisite, appealing
profile.</p>

<p>“A man she’s only known a few months,” pursued Bertha
bitterly. “And she’ll disobey her parents, the mother who’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
loved and guarded and cherished her all her life, and break
their hearts, for his sake.”</p>

<p>“God grant the poor child may not regret it bitterly one
day,” breathed Nina piously.</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Bertha, and slowly stood up. “There’s a
lot to be done.”</p>

<p>“Do let me help you, dearest.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Nina, if you would. The girls are somewhere,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Ah, they’ll be a comfort to you, I hope. They who owe
you even more than Hazel does, if possible.”</p>

<p>“One does what one can. It seems to me that it’s all give,
give, give on our side, and take, take, take on theirs. I feel
rather like an unfortunate pelican feeding its young, sometimes.”</p>

<p>With the words, and the curt laugh that dismissed them,
Bertha Tregaskis regained possession of herself.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSAMUND, though unhappy, was not as unhappy as
she would have liked to think herself. The defection
of Morris Severing, although gaining in poignancy
by contrast with Hazel’s serene happiness, was a sorrow
of the emotions only, and a certain fierce sincerity of
outlook prevented Rosamund from rating it otherwise.</p>

<p>But she felt that she could have borne it better had the
disappearance of her quondam lover touched the mainsprings
of her life, and left that life dignified by a lasting
grief, instead of merely rendered unprofitable and savourless
from an unrecognized sense of vague discontent.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Rosamund’s grievance <i>is</i>!” her
guardian was exasperated into exclaiming, nearly a year
after Hazel’s marriage. “I don’t believe she knows herself.”</p>

<p>And, in so saying, diagnosed the case.</p>

<p>Rosamund Grantham, after the manner of the modern
generation, had yet to find herself, and suffered accordingly.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be added that she did not confine her
sufferings to herself.</p>

<p>Frances, overwhelmed by the difficulties of reconciling
responsiveness to Cousin Bertie’s bracing councils of self-reliance,
with submission to Rosamund’s intensely protective
and rather overpowering solicitude, sought more frequently
than ever the soothing society of Nina Severing.</p>

<p>That gentle soul was passing through a period of storm of
which she presently confided the outline to Frances.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, darling, as I sit here alone through the long
evenings, I wonder if my life might have been different if
I’d been a more religious woman. You see, Francie, I married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
very, very young. I wasn’t much older than you are
now. My husband was not a man who believed in any very
definite creed, and I was young enough to be altogether
influenced by him.”</p>

<p>It was ever Nina’s custom to lay the errors and omissions
of her past at the door of Geoffrey Severing and her youthful
marriage.</p>

<p>“Should you like to be a Roman Catholic?” asked
Frances suddenly.</p>

<p>“It’s a very beautiful religion, and of course beauty is a
religion in itself, to an artist,” said Nina thoughtfully.
“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“I’ve often thought,” said Frances very shyly, “that I
should like it myself. It seems such a thorough-going sort
of religion. When we were little, my mother had a Catholic
maid—an Irish girl—and she used to tell us a lot about it.
And she was so particular about not eating meat on certain
days and going to Mass every Sunday. She had to walk
quite a long way, but I don’t believe she ever missed going.
Of course she was very superstitious, and used to want us
to wear medals and charms and things, but some of the
prayers she taught us were nice. My mother was a Catholic
by birth, too, though she never went to church or anything.”</p>

<p>“If I were anything, I should certainly be a Catholic,”
said Nina with extreme conviction in her tone. “It’s the
only creed which appeals to me in the slightest degree. It is
so beautiful—all that music and those touching ideas about
the Virgin and everything.”</p>

<p>“But—don’t you believe?—isn’t the Church——?”
murmured Frances, embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Dear child, I am afraid the orthodox forms mean very
little to me. I would never wilfully cause pain to any human
being, and I try to help the sadness of the world with
my little songs, but that is all. But I would never shatter
the innocent faith of another soul, although I have outgrown
the need of form and ritual myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Does one outgrow it?” wistfully asked Frances, whose
whole nature unconsciously craved the discipline which is
inseparable from any creed, faithfully followed out in practice.</p>

<p>“Not all of us,” tenderly said Nina, conscious of the exquisite
contrast between the matured, self-reliant soul, made
strong through suffering, and the innocent, inquiring child at
her knee. “Not all of us, dear. Some plants need a support
round which to cling, whilst others stand alone—always
alone.” Her voice deepened slightly as she mused
broodingly for a moment on the pathos and beauty of this
horticultural parable. It came as a slight shock when
Frances, generally the most sympathetic of listeners, observed
in unmistakably self-absorbed accents:</p>

<p>“I think that I shall always want a support. It seems
to me that I am meant to live by rule—not by my own judgment
at all. That’s why I like the Roman Catholic idea of
the Church being infallible. It would be such a guide.”</p>

<p>Nina was aware that to no one else would Frances have
spoken so unreservedly, and the reflection was soothing, but
it did not prevent a slight stiffening of tone in her reply.</p>

<p>“Really, dear? But the surest guide in the world is the
golden rule which I have tried to live up to all my life—<i>Never
think of yourself at all</i>. Somehow, if one gives all
one’s thoughts and time to other people, one finds that God
takes care of the rest.”</p>

<p>Nina was herself rather surprised at the beauty of the
sentiment as she put it into words, and it served to restore
her not very deeply ruffled serenity.</p>

<p>“I will lend you some books, Frances, if you really want
to know something about various creeds. The religion of
Buddha is, to my mind, the most beautiful of them all,” reflectively
said Nina, who had once read portions of Sir
Edwin Arnold’s translation of the “Light of Asia,” and
was persuaded that she had studied it deeply. “It was the
foundation of the Roman Catholic religion, of course—they
borrowed a great deal from it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“I should like to read it very much.”</p>

<p>Frances wanted to read anything which spoke, however
indirectly, of Roman Catholic doctrines. If Nina guessed
as much, however, she did not impart her surmise to the
vigorously orthodox Bertha Tregaskis.</p>

<p>That this discreet reticence had been justified was made
superabundantly evident when Mrs. Tregaskis first became
aware of the Romanistic tendencies of her ward.</p>

<p>“People of seventeen must do what they’re told,” she
said serenely, but with an undercurrent of severity. “When
you’re one-and-twenty, Francie, we’ll talk about it again, and
meanwhile I strongly advise you not to think about the subject.
You are much too young to decide such a matter without
knowing a great deal more about it, and from your own
showing all this simply arises from restlessness and desire
for excitement. Religion is too serious a matter to be
played with, my dear little girl.”</p>

<p>A certain look of flintlike impenetrability came over
Frances’ young face as she looked at her guardian, and she
said nothing more. But Mrs. Tregaskis was much too acute
to suppose that her silence denoted submission.</p>

<p>“Take her to London,” growled Frederick, when his wife,
in her perplexity, put the case before him. “You ought to
get her away from that silly woman’s influence.”</p>

<p>Bertha did not ask “What silly woman?” since she rightly
recognized that her husband thus denoted her dearest friend,
but she decided to follow his advice.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a month in London, and see all the sights,”
she cried. “Just you and I and Rosamund, Francie, and be
regular country cousins, and go to the National Gallery and
British Museum, and a theatre or two from the dress-circle.
Never mind about planting the bulbs, dear—no, I don’t
mind leaving them to Grant, and the garden must just get
on without me for a week or two.”</p>

<p>She stifled a sigh heroically.</p>

<p>“This trip is absolutely for the sake of the girls,” she told
Nina Severing. “Neither of them takes any natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
healthy interest in gardening or in the animals and things, as
Hazel used to do, so I must try what London will do for
them. Really, girls <i>are</i> a problem.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to a boy,” sighed Nina. “There’s Morris
wandering half over Europe, in the most unsatisfactory
manner, pretending that he is studying languages, and really
doing nothing at all except loaf. I’ve told him he ought to
come back and look after the place in earnest, but he makes
one excuse after another——”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” said Bertha sympathetically. “Perhaps
if he came back, now that he and Rosamund are a little older
and have rather more sense....”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear! he’s got over that nonsense long ago. I
always told you it wouldn’t last. ‘Weak and unstable as
water,’ that’s what my poor Morris is.”</p>

<p>Bertha did not remind Mrs. Severing that everything had
been done to insure the instability of Morris in this particular
case. She only said affectionately:</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, Nina darling. Don’t forget to take pity
on my old man, since I can’t drag him to London.”</p>

<p>“He must come and cheer me up some afternoon, if he
will,” cordially responded Nina. Both ladies were perfectly
aware that Frederick Tregaskis would do nothing of the
sort, and that there were few things less conducive to the
cheering up of either than an encounter between him and
Mrs. Severing. But they exchanged their fallacious hopes
with an air of affectionately reassuring one another.</p>

<p>“I’ve one comfort,” declared Bertie, “I’m hoping to see a
very old friend of mine in town: Sybil Argent. I believe
she and her son are there for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she become a Catholic?” asked Nina, with a sudden
air of intense interest, which provoked Bertha to a display
of extreme nonchalance instantly.</p>

<p>“Let me see—did she? Oh yes. I believe she <i>has</i> become
a Roman. Silly woman! Got under the influence of
some priest or other, I fancy. She was never over-wise,
though a dear, sweet thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“There is a wisdom which is not of this world,” said
Nina, upraising her eyes, and with an air of quotation.</p>

<p>Bertha laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“My dear Nina! It’s really too funny to hear you quoting
Scripture. Or is it only some mystical poet of the new
set? Anyhow, poor Sybil Argent has been a Romanist for
some years now, I fancy, and of course one wouldn’t say
anything about it, though I quite expect to have it all poured
out to me—my friends have the quaintest knack of confiding
in me. I rather fancy I know more secrets than most
people.”</p>

<p>“That comes of always having your eyes and ears open,”
declared Nina with playful sweetness, “instead of keeping
your head in the clouds, as I’m afraid mine too often
is.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell you not to get the stares, as I do the
children when they sit gaping at vacancy,” pleasantly replied
her friend, and took her departure under this agreeable
analogy.</p>

<p>“Poor dear Nina’s affectation of mysticism is really <i>too</i>
absurd,” she told herself, and added quite illogically: “No
wonder Francie is infected by it. It will be a comfort to
talk to a rational woman again—which I suppose Sybil still
is, in spite of having allowed herself to be bitten by the
Romanist craze.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Tregaskis was not destined to probe the measure
of her friend’s rationality. Lady Argent had already left
London when she arrived, and she was obliged to be content
with inviting Ludovic Argent to dinner.</p>

<p>“Can you remember him, Rosamund?” she inquired with
kindly interest.</p>

<p>“Of course,” curtly retorted her ward, with the offended
intonation which implied that Cousin Bertie had forgotten
the number of Rosamund’s years.</p>

<p>“We weren’t so very little when we went over to Lady
Argent’s,” apologetically said Frances. “I was nine, and I
can remember her and the son quite well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Of course,” said her guardian. “I wonder if he will
have forgotten you.”</p>

<p>Ludovic had not forgotten Rosamund and Frances. He
looked forward curiously to seeing what the years had made
of the little girl whom he had found crouching outside the
door of the library.</p>

<p>His first impression was of pleasure at her undeniable
beauty, and he was glad to find himself placed between her
and Mrs. Tregaskis at dinner. Frances and a couple of
negligible young men completed the party.</p>

<p>The whole-hearted virility of Mrs. Tregaskis dominated
the conversation, which at first was general, but Ludovic
noted with a certain surprise that she no longer provoked
in him anything but a detached amusement. That it was far
otherwise with Rosamund he felt convinced. There was
latent hostility in her every glance and gesture, and she diffused
an atmosphere of discontent that affected Ludovic
strangely.</p>

<p>“She gives one a sense of unrest,” he reflected disappointedly.
“The little sister, now, though she, too, is self-centred,
has stability and a certain amount of poise. But
Rosamund is unbalanced.” He tried to translate the impression
into physical terms. “It’s as though the chemical
ingredients in a retort had been carelessly flung together,
regardless of power or proportion, and the solution in consequence
is a mere seething chaos—fine material wasted.
But what a fool I am—she can’t be more than twenty.
The solution is still to come.”</p>

<p>They talked about books, and he saw her grey eyes light
up with eagerness. When she became impersonal she
seemed to him wholly charming.</p>

<p>“It is her relation to humanity that is at fault,” reflected
the psychologist.</p>

<p>“You have never been back to the Wye Valley since you
were a child, have you?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“No,” she said briefly, and added with a candid impulse
of unreserve, “I don’t want to go back there until I go back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
for good. The cottage is ours, you know, and one day
Francie and I will go back there to live.”</p>

<p>“Is that your ideal?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, in the tone of one who seeks to
convince herself.</p>

<p>Ludovic found himself wondering whether it was also
the ideal of Frances. There was something which struck
him as remote, almost austere, in her young personality, and
it was almost with the sense of a presentiment confirmed that
he heard from Bertha Tregaskis, later in the evening, of the
disquieting tendencies of her ward.</p>

<p>“She’s a dear little kiddie,” were the words, striking
Ludovic as singularly inappropriate, which prefaced the
recital of Bertha’s perplexities, “but this religious phase is
very tiresome. One knows that all young things go through
it, like measles, but this seems to be a particularly violent
attack.”</p>

<p>“Would there be any very vital objection to her joining
the Roman Catholic Church?”</p>

<p>Bertha hesitated.</p>

<p>“No-o—only on general principles. I believe her
mother was a Roman Catholic, as far as baptism went, but
Dick was quite firm about having the children brought up in
his own faith, and I don’t fancy poor Rose cared either way.
The children knew precious little when they came to me, but
of course they learnt their catechism and all the rest of it
with my Hazel. I believe in giving children a thoroughly
orthodox grounding, at all events. Frances was always
more inclined to be ‘pi,’ as my schoolboy friends call it, than
either of the other two.”</p>

<p>“Temperamentally religious?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. That’s generally the sort that suffers
from the worst reaction. Poor mite, she told me quite
gravely that she needed an intellectual discipline.”</p>

<p>“I have seldom heard a better reason for joining the
Church of Rome,” said Ludovic gravely.</p>

<p>“She’s picked up the phrase from some book, I suppose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Poor little thing! It makes one smile, and at the same time
sigh, to hear anything so very, very young. One went
through it all oneself so many years ago, and eventually came
back to just the old way of thinking—as one’s parents before
one. But I’m talking as though you were a contemporary,”
said Bertha laughing, “and forgetting that you belong
to the younger generation yourself.”</p>

<p>Ludovic became aware that this forgetfulness implied a
compliment. He tried to appear gratified, but was no longer
young enough to feel so in reality.</p>

<p>“I am at all events able to sympathize with Miss Frances
in her outlook,” he said slowly. “I do not like what I know
of the Catholic religion, but it would give her the discipline
she craves.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but as I told her, it’s much easier to be
obedient to anyone and everything, sooner than to those to
whom obedience is due,” said Bertha smartly. “If she is
so anxious to submit her own judgment, she can submit it to
mine. But that, of course, is exactly what my young lady
doesn’t choose to do.” There was an acerbity in her tone
that struck Ludovic as over-personal.</p>

<p>“If she really wishes it, I suppose you would not oppose
it a little later on?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said Bertha wearily. “I’ve never been
hide-bound by any creed myself. One learns to be extraordinarily
tolerant, as time goes on. Fresh air, laughter, sunshine,
plenty of work and plenty of friends—that’s my
religion.”</p>

<p>Ludovic had met this breezy, simple creed before, and it
had always failed oddly to carry any conviction to him. It
failed again now.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly. “You know my mother became
a Catholic some years ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes—she wrote to me. It seems to have made her very
happy.”</p>

<p>“I think it has,” said Ludovic simply. Thereafter their
talk turned upon Lady Argent and the Wye Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>It was, however, directly attributable to the foregoing
conversation that Mrs. Tregaskis shortly after her return to
Porthlew received an invitation for Frances.</p>

<p>“Do let Frances come to me for a nice long visit,” wrote
Lady Argent; “and Rosamund, too, if she likes, but Ludovic
thinks that perhaps she would not care to be so near her
old home. But I should love to have either, or both, and if
Frances is really thinking of adopting her mother’s religion,
it seems only fair that she should see something of a Catholic
atmosphere. I will not let her do anything rash, dear Bertie,
and I am sure it will be a real rest for you to have no young
things on your hands for a little while.”</p>

<p>“It would indeed!” quoth Bertha, rather grimly, as she
imparted portions of her correspondence to Frederick, who
was rather ostentatiously not listening.</p>

<p>“After all, the best way to get the whole thing out of
her head is to treat it as a matter of course. A persecution
would only make her more determined to be a little martyr—Frederick,
are you listening to me?”</p>

<p>“I am reading—or endeavouring to read—my evening
paper,” replied Frederick with unvarnished candour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis had recourse to a stratagem by which she
was frequently obliged to compel her husband’s attention.</p>

<p>She addressed her next remark, in a mysteriously lowered
voice, exclusively to the attentive Miss Blandflower.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Minnie, that the child fancies there is more
difference between the English Church and the Roman one
than there is. She is very ignorant, and so imagines a great
deal. If she saw rather more of Romanism, I fancy it
would be a case of either kill or cure.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” returned Miss Blandflower acutely, “that
she would either want to become a Roman Catholic at once,
or else see through the whole thing and give up the idea
altogether.”</p>

<p>“Exactly—probably the latter. There’s nothing in the
Roman Catholic religion, once you get over the preliminary
glamour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“To be or not to be,” said Minnie with thoughtful irrelevance.</p>

<p>“With the exceptions of the Pope, and the worship of the
Virgin Mary, they have nothing that we haven’t got—Frances
can be as High Church as she pleases.”</p>

<p>“Not in <i>my</i> house,” said Frederick unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Why not, dear? It’s a great deal better than turning
Roman Catholic outright.”</p>

<p>“You’ve just said that it came to exactly the same thing.”</p>

<p>Bertha looked rather nonplussed for an instant, but recovered
herself by exchanging a glance of good-humoured intelligence
with Minnie, expressing very distinctly, “How like a
man!”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, Frederick,” she returned in soothing accents,
“it will probably all end in smoke. That’s my object in letting
her go to Sybil for a bit. She will see that there’s nothing
in it, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“An aching void,” was Minnie’s further contribution to
the discussion.</p>

<p>Frederick retired behind his paper again.</p>

<p>“What a rest it would be to you if you could have the
house to yourself for a bit!” said Miss Blandflower, looking
fondly at Bertha.</p>

<p>“Well, I own that it would. This last year has been a
trying one, for various reasons.”</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower, who knew as well as Bertha herself
that these various reasons were all embodied in Mrs.
Tregaskis’s only daughter, preserved a discreet silence.</p>

<p>“Well! that’s that,” was Bertha’s summing up. “I’ll see
what the girls say. No doubt Rosamund will raise difficulties,
poor child”—she laughed a little—“I’ve never yet
known her fall in with any plan one suggested.”</p>

<p>“She’s very contr<i>a</i>ry,” sighed Minnie, shaking her head.</p>

<p>Their forebodings proved to be well-founded. Rosamund
did not wish to accept Lady Argent’s invitation.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to ask her <i>why</i>,” said Bertha exasperatedly,
“I know too well that that’s exactly what she wants—tiresome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
child! No, Minnie, I’d rather you don’t discuss
it with her. The whole thing is pose, ‘pour faire s’occuper
d’elle,’ and the less notice one takes of her the sooner she
may get over this silly phase of always wanting to differ
from everybody else.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I point out to her that it might give you something
of a rest if they were both away for a little while?”
asked Minnie mournfully.</p>

<p>“I’d really rather you didn’t, dear old Minnie. I know
how nicely you’d put it,” said Bertha untruthfully, “but I
don’t want to give her any excuses for trumping up a grievance—thinking
one wanted to get rid of her, or anything
of that sort. Oh no, my dear—I shall jog along all right.
There’s plenty of life in the old dog yet!”</p>

<p>“There’s no rest for the wicked,” groaned Miss Blandflower,
with no uncomplimentary intent.</p>

<p>“Not this side of the grave,” agreed Bertha cheerfully.
“But—well, I will own to you, Minnie, that I sometimes
wish those two were rather more like other people. It seems
so extraordinary that they can’t lead the normal lives of
ordinary girls—but one of them must take a week’s silly
flirtation as though it were a tragedy, and the other gives
me no rest because she wants ‘the intellectual discipline of
the Catholic Church’!”</p>

<p>She laughed as she spoke, but Minnie exclaimed almost
tearfully:</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Tregaskis, it <i>does</i> seem hard, when you’ve
been so unutterably good to them. If only they’d been your
own daughters they would have turned out very differently,
I feel sure.”</p>

<p>This rather infelicitous example drove Mrs. Tregaskis
silently from the room.</p>

<p>A week later saw Frances’ departure from Porthlew.</p>

<p>“I wish you were coming too, Rosamund,” she said, unaware
how cordially her guardian was endorsing the wish.</p>

<p>Rosamund said: “Write and tell me all about everything.
Good-bye, darling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Not even to her sister would she admit the mixture of
defiance and sentimentality which had prompted her refusal
to visit the Wye Valley.</p>

<p>“Not until I go there for good,” she told herself dreamily.</p>

<p>It was the expression of a perfectly unconscious egotism.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FRANCES and her hostess found themselves in perfect
harmony. It did not occur to Frances that the eight
years which had transformed her from a child to a
young girl had changed Lady Argent a great deal more.
Discursive she had always been, but her talk had now
become almost wandering, and her always gentle volubility
had increased surprisingly. The amusement, tempered by
slight dismay, with which Ludovic listened to his parent’s
verbal flights, was quite unshared by Frances. Lady Argent
talked about the Catholic Church, about which Frances
wanted to learn all that she could, and each was serenely
content.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any scruples, dear, about telling you all that
you want to know,” Lady Argent unnecessarily informed
her guest, “because dear Bertie is so broad-minded and honest
herself that I know she wouldn’t mind. And it seems
only fair to counteract all those dreadful years that you’ve
spent with Protestants, poor child, who have such very
strange ideas about the Faith. Like Indulgences, you know—so
terribly misunderstood, I always think—paid permission
to commit sin for a hundred days, I’ve even heard
people suggest—ignorant Protestants, you know.”</p>

<p>“They are not all as ignorant as that,” justice compelled
Frances to observe.</p>

<p>“I never <i>can</i> remember that you are still a Protestant,
poor child. You don’t mind being called so, I hope?”</p>

<p>Frances was much too embarrassed to reply, but fortunately
Lady Argent did not wait for a disclaimer.</p>

<p>“To think that I once held those shocking notions myself,
dear. I really can hardly believe it now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“How long is it since you became a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“Six years, dear child. It all seems like a dream—the
time before one had the Faith, you know. It all
happened in such a wonderful way. I was staying at the
seaside with a poor old Catholic aunt of mine who was
dying, and she had a great friend who was a nun in a convent
there. So she used to ask me to go and give this old
nun news of her from time to time, and I went. Mother
Serafina her name was, and I always think it’s such a beautiful
name, though I dare say that’s just association, since,
of course, one couldn’t exactly call one’s daughter Serafina,
and in any case I don’t think nuns are allowed to be
godmothers even if one asked her to—— Where was I,
dear?”</p>

<p>“You were telling me how you went to the convent to
give the nun news of your aunt.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, and the little parlour was so dreadfully bare
and cold, <i>as it seemed to me then</i>,” mysteriously interpolated
Lady Argent as though some concealed source of heat in the
little fireless room had since been revealed to her; “but
there she sat, always smiling away, and that great brown
rosary at her side. So sympathetic always, and the whole
community praying every day for my poor aunt; and I
remember one day she told me that she would pray every
day for me, too, because of the anxiety and everything, you
know, dear. So charitable and broad-minded, I always think,
because I hadn’t any idea of being a Catholic at all then.
But the Church always prays for those outside the Fold in
the most touching way.”</p>

<p>“I always like when we say the prayer for Jews and
Roman Catholics, once a year,” said Frances thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Lady Argent flushed in a most agitated way.</p>

<p>“Pray don’t talk of it, my dear. It makes me very angry
indeed. The idea of their praying for us as heretics! and
calling us <i>Roman</i> Catholics, too! Such impertinence, I always
think.”</p>

<p>Frances wisely forbore to say anything further. “Tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
me some more about Mother Serafina,” she pacifically suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, I went to see her very frequently, and
quite as much for my own sake as for poor Aunt Charlotte’s,
who was quite past understanding things by that time—a
sort of senile paralysis the doctor said it was, though
I think myself it was only second childhood, as they call it;
and of course she was very weak, and sinking a little every
day. Nothing but beef-tea and milk, dear, and her rosary
always in her hand, though I’m sure she couldn’t say a bead.
She was a most devout Catholic, and the priest used to come
and see her every day—and I remember I couldn’t bear
him, which shows what a dreadful thing prejudice is. He
was an Irishman, and very stout—I remember the stairs
were such a trial to him—and really I could hardly understand
a word he said, he spoke with such a brogue. I am
afraid,” said Lady Argent with unutterable melancholy,
“that I was far from looking upon him as I should have
done, with the reverence due to a priest. He always used
snuff, which seemed to me such a disgusting habit, and his
hair wanted cutting so dreadfully. I am afraid I was most
dreadfully narrow-minded about him, and I’m sure he was
a very holy man.”</p>

<p>“It was a pity he was—untidy,” said Frances delicately.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, but one is especially taught by the Church not
to make rash judgments. I dare say I missed many graces
by not talking to poor old Father O’Leary.</p>

<p>“However, poor Aunt Charlotte died, and I had to stay on
after the funeral, sorting her things—such a collection, my
dear! and I found so many references in her old letters and
papers to my dear husband and myself, and wishing so much
we might become Catholics. Not that dear Ludovic’s father
would ever have dreamed of such a thing, though, of course,
God can do anything he pleases; but dear Fergus was a
Scotchman, and if he had one prejudice stronger than any
other, it was against Romanists, as he always called them.
Of course, if the Lord had willed it....” said Lady Argent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
very doubtfully, and shaking her head at the memory of the
late Sir Fergus Argent’s determination, as opposed to Divine
Omnipotence.</p>

<p>“But dear Fergus had been dead a long while, even then,
and no doubt he views things very differently now. It’s
such a comfort to feel that he <i>must</i> thoroughly approve, now,
whereas if he’d been alive I’m very much afraid, dear, shocking
though it is to say so, that he would have disliked my
becoming a Catholic quite dreadfully—in fact, I really
don’t know what might have happened.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent devoted a moment to the consideration of
her spouse’s probable attitude towards her adoption of the
Catholic faith, and hastily abandoned the <i>tableau</i> thus conjured
up with a slight shudder.</p>

<p>“God certainly knows what He is about, dear,” she said
thankfully.</p>

<p>“Did you go on seeing Mother Serafina at the Convent?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. I had grown very fond of her by that time—and
talked to her a great deal, and I shall never forget what
a shock it was when I found I couldn’t ask her to stay with
me here. She told me the nuns had all made vows of perpetual
enclosure, you know, dear, and couldn’t move a yard
out of the grounds except for the most serious reasons and
with a dispensation from the Holy Father himself. And it
wasn’t at all like the sort of old convent gardens one reads
about, with alleys and box-hedges and cedars and things, but
quite a tiny little gravel court at the back of the house, and
only a plane-tree in one corner. In fact, I don’t know how
all the community and the plane-tree and everything ever
fitted into it at all, when they were out there for the midday
recreation, though some of them did walk backwards, but I
think that was only so as to see the Superior and hear what
she was saying. But I’m sure they must all have bumped
into the plane-tree a number of times. However, they all
seemed very happy, and Mother Serafina always told me she
had never known what happiness was until she became a nun.”</p>

<p>“It must be wonderful,” breathed Frances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“Yes, dear, quite wonderful, but that’s what the grace of
a vocation is. Quite supernatural, I always think, to leave
one’s home and everything and live such a life—detachment,
you know, dear.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” ventured Frances, “it must be rather sad
for the father and mother of a nun—to let her go, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Dreadful, my dear. But one would always feel so glad
and thankful, though so dreadfully sorry—you know what
I mean,” lucidly returned Lady Argent. “I really don’t
know what one would do if one had a daughter a nun—say
one’s only child—though, of course, even as a girl, I can
hardly imagine dear Ludovic a nun, but one never
knows——” Lady Argent looked distractedly into the fire.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” she murmured, “I am afraid that I idolize
Ludovic. I lie awake at night, you know, dear, wondering
what I should do if he were ever to be burnt to death.”</p>

<p>“But why should he be burnt to death?” said the literal
Frances fixing horrified eyes on her hostess.</p>

<p>“At the stake, you know, dear, just as so many martyrs
have been, even in England—you know what Tyburn is,
dear: so dreadful, I always think; and though one ought
not to look upon any soul as being outside the pale of God’s
grace, that terrible Queen Elizabeth, with Mary Stuart’s
blood upon her head and everything—— So that if persecution
<i>should</i> begin again—and, after all, dear, look at
France, and all those poor good Dominicans turned out of
their holy monastery—and if Ludovic was by that time a
Catholic, as one prays and hopes, should I be able to let him
go? Let alone being like the Mother of the Maccabees,
though I always felt certain, even when I was a Protestant,
that that was a sort of miracle, because one knows what one
would feel about one, let alone seven—though really I dare
say by the time those frightful tortures had begun on the
youngest she had almost ceased to feel anything at all, except
thankfulness that there were no more to come. But when I
think how often I have wickedly rebelled at my poor Ludovic’s
being lame——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Was he always?” gently inquired Frances.</p>

<p>“From the time he was a few weeks old, dear, and I’ve
often thought that if I’d been a Catholic then, and put a pair
of scapulars round my poor little darling’s neck, the accident
would never have happened.”</p>

<p>On this melancholy reflection the door opened, and Lady
Argent’s poor little darling came into the room.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want the lights, mother? It’s nearly dark,
and I’ve brought you the second post.”</p>

<p>Ludovic turned on the light as he spoke, and gave a
small packet of letters and newspapers into his mother’s
hands, shaking his head reproachfully as he did so.</p>

<p>She looked up guiltily.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing much, darling—only a little magazine
called <i>Beads</i>, and <i>The Catholic Fireside</i> and a—a few letters.”</p>

<p>Ludovic laughed gently.</p>

<p>“And how many of those are begging letters, dear?”</p>

<p>Lady Argent looked through the little heap, appearing
rather distraught.</p>

<p>“This is a receipt,” she declared triumphantly, waving a
sheet of cheap glazed notepaper closely covered with neat,
angular writing.</p>

<p>“It’s a very long one,” said Ludovic suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Those poor French sisters at Coleham-on-Sea! The
Superior has actually taken the trouble to write herself, and
I only sent them the most dreadful old things: not clothes
only, Francie, dear—though some of Ludovic’s old vests,
not fit to give to the poor people here—but hair-brushes
without any bristles—and even that seems a mockery, since
their hair is all cut off when they take their first vows, I
believe—so unwise not to wait till the final ones, I always
think, though no doubt the Church has her reasons; and
books with half the leaves torn out; and even a dreadful
little half-empty pot of rouge, which my maid actually put in
though she never told me till afterwards. No, Ludovic, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
really shouldn’t laugh. I can’t think where such a thing
came from, for I’ve certainly never used it in my life, and I
can’t bear to think of the scandal it may have given those
dear good Sisters of the Poor.”</p>

<p>“Do they make any allusion to it?” asked Ludovic, with
boyish amusement in his laughing eyes.</p>

<p>Lady Argent scanned the closely-written sheets.</p>

<p>“No, dear. ‘Those good and useful gifts, such joy for
poor people’—that <i>can’t</i> be the hair-brush, can it?—‘we
can never thank you enough for your generosity to us’—dear,
dear, it does make one feel so dreadfully mean. ‘We
shall have the wherewithal to decorate a Christmas-tree for
our little ones’—Ludovic! they can’t give the poor children
my broken air-cushion or that torn mackintosh of yours—or
the old dog-collar. ‘You will certainly be rewarded for
this great generosity and our poor prayers....’ Oh dear,
dear, this is very touching,” said poor Lady Argent, folding
up her letter with an air of remorse.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they can get money by selling the things after
they’ve mended them up,” whispered Frances consolingly.
Ludovic heard her, and looked at her very kindly, but he
only said:</p>

<p>“Now, mother, tell me what your next correspondent
means by putting ‘Sag’ in the corner of the envelope? Is
it the same sort of thing as Mizpah or Swastika, or whatever
the thing is that housemaids have on their brooches?”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” said Lady Argent with an air of great reserve.
“Quite different. It isn’t ‘Sag’ at all.”</p>

<p>Ludovic held out a corner of the envelope to Frances.</p>

<p>“I appeal to you. If that isn’t ‘Sag,’ what is it?”</p>

<p>She looked, half-laughing, towards Lady Argent.</p>

<p>“Ludovic, dear, pray don’t be so ridiculous. It’s S.A.G.,
my dear boy, and stands for ‘St. Anthony guide,’ just to
make sure the letter doesn’t go astray. I don’t say I put it
on my own letters but it’s a very pious little custom—and
letters <i>might</i> get lost, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“I do not think that this one would have been any great
loss,” rather grimly replied her son. “It’s a begging-letter,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Lady Argent took out sundry enclosures, glanced through
them and exclaimed triumphantly:</p>

<p>“Not at all! In fact it’s just the contrary. It’s from
those Sisters in Dublin, offering me tickets in their great
charity lottery, and with a list of the prizes. It’s really quite
wonderful—a wonderful opportunity,” repeated Lady
Argent, with more wistfulness than conviction in her tone.</p>

<p>Ludovic took the badly typewritten strip of paper from
her hand.</p>

<p>“A live pig, six months old. A harmonium in perfect
repair. A table-centre for the parlour—I should certainly
have a try for that, mother, it would improve the drawing-room;
coloured statue of St. Joseph standing four
feet high, etc., etc. Tickets sixpence, ninepence, or a
shilling.”</p>

<p>“It’s to pay off the debt on their new church, dear,”
replied his mother. “You remember the account of the
opening ceremony that I read you from <i>The Tablet</i> the other
day? So very nice and edifying, but I’m afraid they spent
rather more than they meant to. At any rate they are some
eight hundred pounds in debt over it, I believe, and no doubt
this charity bazaar is to clear some of it off.”</p>

<p>“Raffles are illegal,” quoth Ludovic severely, “and I don’t
think you should encourage them, mother. Please help me
to persuade my mother that charity begins at home, Miss
Frances.”</p>

<p>The modern fashion by which any man becomes entitled
to use the Christian name of any girl spending a week in his
mother’s house, failed altogether to commend itself to
Ludovic Argent.</p>

<p>“The Canon is always in difficulties here, and would be
very glad of money for some of the poor people.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear,” cried Lady Argent. “I am torn in two
as you very well know, and the Canon has been a friend of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
ours for a number of years, but how can I encourage the
spread of Protestantism?”</p>

<p>“You need not, darling. I don’t care a bit about their
spiritual welfare, only their temporal,” coolly observed Ludovic,
“and I’ve sent him a small cheque for the District
Nursing Fund, from both of us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear boy, how can you say such a thing—he
doesn’t mean it, Frances—but I’m really very glad you’ve
done it, and it will show the poor Canon that one isn’t narrow-minded,
and perhaps bring him to see things in another
light.” Lady Argent mused thoughtfully over the imaginary
portrait, than which nothing could have appeared
further from probability to an impartial observer, of a suddenly
Catholicized Canon inspiring his flock with views similar
to his own, and Ludovic glanced thoughtfully at Frances
Grantham.</p>

<p>No hint of humour had disturbed the placid purity of her
intent gaze while listening to Lady Argent and plying her
with gentle questions. She was manifestly absorbed in the
subject, and her natural reverence was in no way shocked
or checked by demonstrations which Ludovic in his own
mind could only qualify as absurd. “She is a born mystic,”
he thought with a sudden conviction that was almost
physical in its intensity, “the stuff to make an ideal lady-abbess.
If she becomes a Catholic, I believe she will be a
nun.”</p>

<p>He felt vaguely compassionate at the idea, and said later
to his mother:</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better to say rather less about religion to
that little girl? She is very impressionable.”</p>

<p>“That’s just why I like talking to her, darling,” returned
Lady Argent ingenuously. “One feels that it is sowing
seed in ground which is all ready for it.”</p>

<p>Ludovic remained silent for a moment, pondering this
excellent reason for the conversion of his mother’s youthful
guest.</p>

<p>“I love having her here,” said his mother, “she is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
sweet. I’m only afraid it’s dull for her. Would she like
her sister to come for a few days, or a friend?”</p>

<p>“Ask her.”</p>

<p>Frances frankly disavowed any wish for companionship
other than that of her hostess, but a few days later she said
to Lady Argent: “Mrs. Severing is staying near here, at
the Towers. I should like to see her, if I may. She has
written me such a kind little note suggesting that I should go
over there, and I am very fond of her.”</p>

<p>“I know you are, my dear,” kindly replied Lady Argent,
who had heard many of Nina’s spiritual upliftings from her
admiring echo. “I should like you to see her, and I should
like to meet her myself. But the fact is—it is a little awkward—I
have never called on the people at the Towers.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” said Frances wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Sir Giles and Lady Cotton, dear. He is the original
founder of Cotton and Sons—the big ironmongers in the
City. That is really why—not the shop, dear, of course,
but the shocking way they treated the poor dear Fathers.
I never could bear to go near them, and I had to give up the
shop altogether, though I’d always dealt there for nearly
twenty years. So I never called on Lady Cotton.”</p>

<p>“What did they do to the Fathers?” asked Frances with
a curiosity unspoilt by the previous recital of many similar
outrages.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear child, it was all about some garden seats
that the Prior ordered for the grounds of their house at
Twickenham—for visitors, you know, because they naturally
have no time to sit on garden seats themselves, as you
can imagine, however tired they may get with all that manual
labour, and getting up at four o’clock in the morning and
everything; and there seems to have been some terrible misunderstanding—with
the shop-people, you know, dear, and
whether the seats were on approval or not. Anyway, they
got left out in the rain all one night, and the paint was spoilt,
and the Prior sent them back and said they couldn’t take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
them after all. But the shop-people were thoroughly unpleasant,
and said the seats must be paid for just the same—most
grasping and disagreeable, even though the letter of the
law may have been on their side. I never quite understood
the ins and outs of it all, but as the Prior, who was the most
simple soul on earth—a Breton, dear, such a nice man—asked
me himself: how they could tell whether they liked the
benches or not until they had seen the effect of bad weather
on them? Which sounds very reasonable indeed, but Cotton
and Sons behaved quite shockingly, and even threatened to
go to law about it. All very well for them, you know, dear—it
would have been an advertisement in a way, but most
unpleasant for the poor Fathers.”</p>

<p>“What was the end of it?”</p>

<p>“They had to pay for the garden seats, dear, and I never
could sit on one with any pleasure, though they are strewn
all over the garden at Twickenham. That is to say,” said
Lady Argent, colouring faintly, “it was—friends—who
actually paid for them, but I never said much to Ludovic
about them. To this day he does not know why I have left
off going to Cotton and Sons.”</p>

<p>Frances did not dare to make any further suggestion for a
<i>rapprochement</i> between Lady Argent and the quondam proprietor
of Cotton and Sons. She only looked wistfully and
undecidedly at the letter in her hand.</p>

<p>“To be sure, my dear, I was forgetting about your friend.
Of course, I do not suppose she has any idea of all this,” said
Lady Argent generously, “since it is not a story that tells
well for Cottons, and I do not suppose Sir Giles cares to
dwell upon it. I really cannot make up my mind to call
upon them—in fact, after all this time I don’t quite see how
I could—but I shall be delighted if Mrs. Severing cares to
come over any day next week. Ludovic could drive you
over to fetch her in time for luncheon. Do write and suggest
it, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much. I know you will like her, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
would love to see you and the garden—and the chapel,”
said Frances rather shyly. “You know she is thinking of
becoming a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“How very delightful. But what can she be waiting for,
dear? She is a widow, and her son, you tell me, is quite a
boy. No doubt she will bring him into the Church too, later
on. By all means, Francie, ask her to come over on Friday,
or whichever afternoon suits her best.”</p>

<p>Frances wrote the invitation gladly.</p>

<p>She was curiously devoid of insight, and it did not occur
to her that any two people of whom she was fond could fail
to like and admire one another.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Mrs. Severing the ‘Nina Severing’ who composes?”
asked Ludovic, as he drove Frances to fetch her
friend.</p>

<p>“Yes. Her music is my favourite modern music. Don’t
you like the ‘Kismet’ songs?”</p>

<p>“I once heard her play,” said Ludovic, avoiding, clumsily,
as he felt, a reply. “Her execution was very brilliant.”</p>

<p>“Meretricious,” was the adjective he had applied to the
popular musician’s talent, at the time.</p>

<p>Ludovic wished that the recollection had not occurred to
him so opportunely.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PERHAPS it was reaction from the materialistic atmosphere
that undoubtedly prevailed at the modern
and opulent mansion of Cotton that was responsible
for the extreme spirituality which marked Mrs. Severing’s
conversation that Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Her golden hair shone against darkly splendid furs, and
her luminous gaze strayed continually to some far horizon
and was continually recalled with a start that just contrived
not to be imperceptible.</p>

<p>“It is too delightful to be in an atmosphere like this one,”
she murmured to Lady Argent in the hall, and bent over her
plate at luncheon for a long moment with a reverence which
far surpassed the gentle murmur in which her hostess indulged.</p>

<p>When curried eggs were succeeded by cutlets Nina cast a
gravely wondering look around her.</p>

<p>“Friday?” she murmured gently. “I wonder if I might
ask—ah! I see you, too, fast on Fridays.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Lady Argent gently, “I only abstain from
meat—really no privation at all—I’m not very fond of
meat, and it’s so much better for one to have fish and eggs
and vegetables and things, quite apart from what one always
feels to be the cruelty of it, though I’m afraid one doesn’t
think about it very often, except just when one actually <i>sees</i>
the lambs playing about in the fields, or the chickens being
killed in that dreadfully cruel way, poor things.”</p>

<p>“We should all be infinitely better physically and mentally
if we only had one meal a day. Just,” said Nina with
poignant simplicity, “a little fruit or uncooked nuts, and a
draught of water. I’ve always said that I should like to
live as the old hermits did.”</p>

<p>Frances was aware that Nina had always said so, and
wondered vaguely why she was for the first time rendered
slightly uncomfortable by the aspiration.</p>

<p>“May I give you some fish, Mrs. Severing?” asked
Ludovic matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>“Please do,” she smiled. “I don’t actually belong to
your beautiful Faith, but I love to live up to all the dear old
symbols.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t call turbot a symbol, exactly,” said Lady
Argent rather doubtfully, “and I do hope you’ll give Mrs.
Severing a respectable slice, my dear boy, for she must be
very hungry after such a long drive.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nina, looking as though a breath would blow
her away altogether. “No.” Her smile repudiated the
mere suggestion of hunger with a delicate completeness.</p>

<p>“I hear you have the most lovely little chapel,” she said
softly, turning to her hostess. “It would be a great pleasure
to me to see it. What a boon one’s little solitary corner for
meditation is! Francie may have told you that I am rather
a wanderer on the face of the earth, and so can appreciate it
doubly.”</p>

<p>Frances, who had always looked upon Mrs. Severing as
the prosperous chatelaine of Pensevern and its adjoining
acres, looked so naïvely astonished that Ludovic felt strongly
inclined to laugh. Instead, however, he charitably engaged
her in a long conversation which enabled Nina to carry out
the skilled presentment of herself which she evidently had in
mind, unhampered by the startled gaze of her earlier acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Ludovic had the chapel built for me, as a surprise while
I was away once,” Lady Argent told her proudly. “So
very dear and kind of him, and I shall never forget my
astonishment, especially as I thought at first that it was a
new bathroom. Not when I went inside, you know, but
we’d talked about having one for a long time, and when I
saw the remains of the workmen outside, I felt sure it must
be that. Ladders and tools and things, you know, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
great bucket of whitewash, such as one naturally associates
with a bathroom, especially if one has it already in one’s
mind, you know. But that was just because Ludovic
thought it would make it lighter.”</p>

<p>“White walls,” murmured Nina symbolically. “I <i>do</i> so
agree. Do you hold your own little services there?”</p>

<p>“The Bishop most kindly lets his own chaplain come over
twice a week and say Mass. You see, the nearest Catholic
Church is some miles away, and going in early isn’t always
possible, although I can always manage Sundays, but of
course it’s the greatest possible blessing to have the Chaplain.
Such a nice man—and not an Irishman,” said Lady
Argent rather thankfully.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my prejudices are rather against parsons of
any denomination,” Nina said with the air of one making a
candid admission. “I always fancy—perhaps it’s just a
fancy peculiar to myself—that one is so much more easily
in tune with the Infinite, without any human intervention.
But then I’m afraid I’m a dreadfully individual person.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Lady Argent quietly, “a Catholic looks
at that quite differently.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but don’t speak as though I were not one of you
in heart, in mind,” cried Nina quickly. “I adore the Catholic
Church, and when I go to Church in London, I always
go to Farm Street or one of your places of worship. I
always say that there is an <i>atmosphere</i> in a Catholic Church
which one finds nowhere else.”</p>

<p>Ludovic caught the words and glanced hastily at his
mother, aware that this well-worn sentiment is as a red rag
to a bull to the devout Catholic. For the remainder of the
meal he firmly directed and maintained the conversation in
undenominational channels.</p>

<p>But after luncheon was over and Nina had smoked two
cigarettes, with an air of detachment that made the act seem
almost saintly, Ludovic left Lady Argent and Frances to
entertain their guest unaided.</p>

<p>“Talk to me,” said Nina gently, turning her enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
eyes on her hostess, “talk to me a little of your wonderful
Faith. I have heard so much of you—and of it—from
my little Francie, and I feel she must have told you that I,
too, am a seeker after truth; things of this world mean so
little—oh, so little!—in comparison with the eternal
quest.”</p>

<p>Receiving no immediate response but the slight bewilderment
slowly becoming apparent on Lady Argent’s face,
Nina glided on her conversational way with much discretion:</p>

<p>“Such things are not to be talked about, are they? They
go too deep. One understands. My own reserve has always
been rather a proverb; but somehow in this sort of
atmosphere—well, it’s deep calling to deep, isn’t it,
rather?”</p>

<p>She laughed a very little, with a perceptible undercurrent
of agitation.</p>

<p>“You’ll let me talk to you quite frankly, won’t you?”
she asked, with an appealing look at Lady Argent. “It’s
so seldom one has the impulse—and my life has been a very
lonely one. Oh, I have my boy, of course—but, then, what
does the younger generation <i>give</i>? Nothing. They <i>can</i>
give us nothing—in the nature of things. It’s all taking on
their side, and sacrifice on ours. One would hardly have it
otherwise—but—— Little Frances knows that I don’t
mean her—she is my little comfort.” Nina tendered a
reassuring, if rather absentminded, hand to her little comfort,
who received it rather perfunctorily, and released it a
good deal sooner than its owner expected.</p>

<p>“My son has always been a companion to me since he
was a child,” said Lady Argent firmly; “and as for sacrifices,
I’ve always felt them to be on his side, if there were
any, since he might have been so much more in touch with
things, living in London—he writes, you know—only my
tiresome asthma is so troublesome there, and he won’t hear
of leaving me. Not that it is a sacrifice, since he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
much rather be with me here, than without me anywhere
else,” she concluded simply.</p>

<p>“How very, very wonderful and beautiful such a relationship
is,” breathed Nina reverently. “Morris and I are all
the world to one another, but he is very, very young—young
for his age, as well—and perhaps the very young
shrink a little from an atmosphere of sadness. You see I
have been all alone for a number of years now. I married
very, very young—a child—and then I was left, with——”</p>

<p>Before Nina had reached the looming allusion to a child
with only a star to guide her, Frances rose quickly and
glided from the room, rather to the relief of Mrs. Severing,
who was becoming increasingly aware of her protégée’s
startled eyes at various new aspects of a recital which she
had supposed she knew by heart.</p>

<p>“That is a very pure, sweet little soul,” said Nina as the
door shut, after the invariable rule which causes minds of a
certain calibre instantly to adopt as subject of conversation
whoever has most recently left the room.</p>

<p>The custom not being one which recommended itself to
Lady Argent, she merely replied with a vague, kind murmur
indicative of goodwill, but of nothing else.</p>

<p>“One does so dislike the idea of discussing <i>les absents</i>,”
said the responsive Nina, with an atrocious accent of which
she was sufficiently conscious to make her slur the words
over rather rapidly, “but I have somehow felt that perhaps
between us we could find out what it is that the child really
<i>needs</i>. I don’t know that beloved Bertha Tregaskis altogether
understands her, though I wouldn’t say so for the
world.”</p>

<p>“Bertie has been very good to them both,” said Lady
Argent loyally. “So wonderful of her, I always think, and
all that dairy work and the Mothers’ Union and everything
as well—simply marvellous.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” cried Nina, “quite the most practical
woman I know, and my dearest friend in the world. Attraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
of opposites, I suppose. I always think that she
and I are the two types—Martha and Mary—active and
contemplative, you know.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent, to whom Nina’s favourite <i>mot</i> was naturally
new, looked more than a little doubtful.</p>

<p>“Dear Bertie is very wonderful altogether,” she murmured.
“Her insight and sympathy, you know, and then
her humility—it’s really quite touching to hear her blame or
ridicule herself, when one is so full of admiration—all her
gifts, you know, intellectual as well as practical.”</p>

<p>“Ah, those clever dialect imitations!” cried Nina, with
an enthusiasm that strove subtly to confine Bertha’s mental
attainments to dialect imitations. “She’s so original, isn’t
she? And at one time she used to scribble a little, you
know—just trifles for the magazines, but <i>quite</i> clever. I
remember going through one or two of the proof-sheets for
her—Bertie is always so ridiculously determined to think
that I can write myself, you know, and wanted me to polish
up some of her descriptions of travel—not, of course, that
I’m really much good, though I’ve always thought I should
<i>like</i> to write, if I could find the time.”</p>

<p>“Music, of course, has taken up most of your time.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes—my art. It’s been everything, of course.”</p>

<p>“It would be the greatest possible pleasure if you would
play to us a little this afternoon. Ludovic loves music, and
really knows a great deal about it,” said Lady Argent, believing
herself to be stating a fact.</p>

<p>“One can always play to a true lover of music,” murmured
Nina. “I often feel that with little Francie—child
though she is.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Grantham was so very musical, poor thing!”
ejaculated Lady Argent, who would have felt it almost an
irreverence to omit the epithet in the case of one deceased.
“It is a pity the girls have not inherited her gift. They
neither of them play, do they, or is Rosamund musical?”</p>

<p>“Not in the very least,” replied Nina, who rather disliked
Rosamund. “She does not know the meaning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
word. Between ourselves, dear Lady Argent, Rosamund is
not a very taking sort of girl, although she’s prettier than
Frances—in fact,” she added, with the easy generosity of
an extremely and maturely attractive woman, “she is quite
unusually pretty. But that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I thought she was clever.”</p>

<p>Nina shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“It’s not the sort of cleverness that attracts,” she said
shrewdly. “Hazel Tregaskis, before she married, had
twice the success that Rosamund had. Now, of course, with
money and clothes and things, and that romantic story about
her marriage, Hazel is too popular for words, though she’s
really not pretty in the least—only very bright and attractive.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent, who did not think that Hazel Tregaskis’s
marriage with Sir Guy Marleswood was a sufficiently reputable
subject to be mentioned, except to the Almighty, with
whom she occasionally pleaded piously for the first Lady
Marleswood’s demise, maintained a rather weighty silence.</p>

<p>Nina rippled lightly through it.</p>

<p>“Rosamund is rather the sort of girl who likes to go about
looking like a tragedy-queen, and for no particular reason,
you know. There was a very foolish and youthful love affair,”
said Nina with an air of extreme detachment, “which
only lasted about a week, and meant nothing at all, but she
has quite got over that—so that her air of having a grievance
is really affectation. You know anything which fails to
ring quite true does jar so—one feels it instinctively—in a
moment. Don’t you agree?”</p>

<p>Lady Argent looked as though she were torn between
truth and an unaccountable desire to contradict her visitor,
and it was a slight but distinct relief to them both when
Ludovic came into the room.</p>

<p>“Are you going to be kind enough to let us hear you play,
Mrs. Severing?” he asked her. “The piano is an Erard,
and though it is not new, I should very much like you to try
it, if you will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Do,” said Lady Argent cordially.</p>

<p>Ludovic wondered whether the cordiality sprang from a
certain weariness which he thought that he could detect in
his parent’s expression. It seemed to him that one might
weary rather speedily in Mrs. Severing’s company. But
when she was seated before the Erard, a load of rings removed
from her white supple fingers, and the sound of one
of her own “Preludes” filling the room, Ludovic felt inclined
to change his mind.</p>

<p>Nina Severing at the piano interested him. He felt that
“meretricious” was still the word that he would apply to
her talent, but her rendering of her own inspirations struck
him as an odd bit of self-revelation.</p>

<p>The “Prelude” was a rapid, highly-technical <i>tour-de-force</i>
of muscular agility, with the merest and most disconnected
thread of melody possible in the treble, and in syncopated
time. Ludovic divined that Nina regarded it as her
masterpiece. She played with great self-confidence and an
amount of force that was rather surprising.</p>

<p>Afterwards, at Lady Argent’s request, she played a
Chopin Polonaise and the too well-known Minute-Waltz.
Her rendering of neither satisfied Ludovic’s taste, but he
listened with an interest that was almost profound.</p>

<p>“She is only sincere when she is dealing with her own
compositions,” was his final verdict. “As an interpreter she
fails altogether. She does not attempt to give us Chopin’s
Chopin, but Nina Severing’s Chopin—the Chopin of the
author of the ‘Kismet’ songs. And so the polonaise becomes
trivial, almost a little vulgar—it is utterly above and
beyond her personality.” He gave himself up to interested
musings, and listened to Nina’s subsequent performances
with his outward ear only.</p>

<p>But Frances and Lady Argent gave the popular musician
her full meed of applause and congratulation.</p>

<p>“How you can ever have time to practise all those things,
and learn them by heart, I can’t imagine,” said Lady Argent
admiringly. “When I think what difficulty I had as a girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
in memorizing a very pretty thing called ‘The Maiden’s
Prayer,’ which I believe is quite out of date nowadays—but
then I was never considered particularly musical. Ludovic
gets it all from his father.”</p>

<p>“Celtic blood,” said Nina, pronouncing the <i>C</i> as though
it had been <i>S</i>. “No—memorizing has never been of much
difficulty to me. Things just seem to <i>come</i>, you know. As
a child I used to spend hours and hours in an old organ-loft,
just playing to myself, you know—always alone, but never
lonely so long as I could make music.” Her eyes deepened
and grew introspective over this pathetic sketch, which happened
to be a fancy one, and it was with a perceptible effort
that she presently shook off her slight appearance of absorption
and once more begged to be shown the chapel.</p>

<p>“Frances will take you, and show you all that there is to
be seen. I know you will forgive me for not undertaking
the stairs oftener than I can help,” said her hostess with a
little hesitation.</p>

<p>“But of course!”</p>

<p>Nina followed her guide with a graceful gesture expressive
of complete understanding.</p>

<p>“Ludovic!” cried Lady Argent in a distraught manner,
as soon as he had carefully closed the door. “I am afraid
it was really very wrong of me to tell such a shocking untruth,
though I did not say in so many words that it would
bring on my asthma if I went upstairs to the chapel, but I
am sure that is what she understood me to mean, and the
worst of it is that I <i>meant</i> her to take it that way, and that is
really just the same thing as telling a downright lie. Because
of course stairs never affect me in the least, as you
very well know, only damp, which the chapel is far from
being, especially with that dear little radiator put in under
Our Lady’s statue. Oh, my dear boy, do you think it was
very wrong of me?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. Why should you have taken her to
the chapel yourself, tiresome woman that she is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush,” said his mother, looking delighted. “Pray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
don’t call her names, Ludovic, my dear, it really is most uncharitable.
But I am dreadfully afraid that I have taken a
terrible dislike to her.”</p>

<p>“What! When she is so much interested in Catholicism?”
asked Ludovic, with a shade of derision in his tone.</p>

<p>“I did not like her manner about the Church at all,” said
Lady Argent with melancholy emphasis. “I really did <i>not</i>,
Ludovic. I have no doubt that it is very uncharitable of me,
but it positively struck me once or twice that she was almost
posing about it all. So unlike dear little Frances, who is so
much in earnest.”</p>

<p>“I believe it was Mrs. Severing who first put the idea of
Catholicism into her head, all the same,” said Ludovic
rather maliciously.</p>

<p>“My dear boy, how can you say such a thing! It was the
grace of God, neither more nor less, and when you consider
that Mrs. Grantham was a Catholic herself, by birth!—though
I’m sure I had no idea of such a thing till just the
other day: but then one was so dreadfully apt to look upon
all foreigners as belonging to some odd fancy religion, or
even nothing at all, in those days. And, of course, poor
thing, she must have given up her religion altogether, or
those children would never have been baptized Protestants,
poor little things, when you think of the promises the non-Catholic
party to a marriage always has to make—but I
suppose Mr. Grantham was never even told about them, let
alone asked to make them.”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” agreed her son placidly.</p>

<p>“Dreadful to think of! And so poor Mrs. Grantham
died without the Last Sacraments or anything at all. If one
had only known in those days! However,” said Lady Argent,
wisely putting the past away from her, “God has His
own ways of doing things, and I have no doubt that Frances
is His chosen instrument for many things—perhaps she
may even bring dear Bertie herself into the Church, one of
these days.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Severing, mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Ludovic! I can’t bear to think of that woman’s first
Confession. I can see her, keeping the poor priest for hours
in the confessional, while she forced all her fancies down
his throat,” said Lady Argent, with the energy that only a
really good woman can put into denunciation.</p>

<p>“Mother!”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear boy, I dare say it is very wrong of me
to say so, and if I am giving you scandal I am sorry for it.
You know very well that I would never say such a thing
before the servants or anybody, though what Charles must
have thought of her at luncheon, calling the turbot symbolical
and everything, I really don’t know. She will have to
have tea before driving all that way back, but pray ring the
bell and let me order it half an hour earlier.”</p>

<p>This inhospitable manœuvre had hardly been put into
execution before Frances and Nina reappeared. The latter
laid her slender, gloveless hand for a moment on Lady Argent’s
sleeve, the blackness of which formed an admirable
foil to extreme whiteness and the flash of diamonds, and said
in tones which almost suggested an emotional <i>tremolo</i>:</p>

<p>“I can’t thank you enough. It’s been a revelation—<i>Coram
sanctissimum!</i>”</p>

<p>Ludovic, with some perspicacity, divined that Mrs. Severing
supposed her fragment of Latinity to be some recondite
version of “<i>sanctum sanctorum</i>,” and tried to look proportionately
gratified, the more so as his mother’s expression
denoted considerable distrust mingled with a most perfunctory
politeness.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” she murmured doubtfully. “Do pray let
me give you some tea—they are just bringing it.”</p>

<p>“The little shrine!” said Nina with a sort of soft rapture.
“It reminded me so much of those little wayside
shrines one saw everywhere in Italy. I have always loved
them.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Italy well?” asked Ludovic.</p>

<p>“I was there years ago—with my husband. I remember,”
said Nina determinedly turning to Lady Argent, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
we had a private audience with the Pope—so interesting,
and he was the dearest old man. I shall never forget kneeling
there—I was a mere child, I married very, very young—to
receive his blessing, and how impressive it all was. He
gave me some beads, too, that I am sure have all sorts of
beautiful Indulgences attached to them, even for a poor little
heretic. Frances knows them—they always hang over my
bed at home. I really could hardly sleep without them.”</p>

<p>Even Frances felt no regret when Mrs. Severing took her
departure.</p>

<p>Neither she nor Lady Argent alluded to the visit that evening,
and Ludovic, on his return from conducting Nina to the
Towers, spent the evening in reading aloud an article on
French literature.</p>

<p>But when his mother rose to go to bed, and he handed her
the small heap of miscellanies without which she seldom
moved, she looked almost coldly at the polished brown
rosary that crowned the little pile.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear boy,” she said rather faintly, taking
them from him, and added, as soon as Frances was out of
earshot, “I assure you that that absurd woman has really
almost put me off saying my rosary for the evening.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHATEVER Lady Argent’s strictures on the length
of time that Mrs. Severing might entertain a
hypothetical director in the confessional, she did
not herself hesitate to inflict upon the Prior at Twickenham
an epistle which covered the better part of six pages.</p>

<p>Ludovic watched his mother’s pen hurrying over her
paper with an uneasy sense of knowing what she was about,
and presently asked her gently:</p>

<p>“Mother dear, you won’t try and persuade Mrs. Tregaskis
into allowing that little girl to do anything in a hurry,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Not for the world, dear,” said Lady Argent, colouring
guiltily. “I quite see what you mean—it would seem very
interfering, and besides, I do not think it would move Bertie
in the least. She is much cleverer than I am, and would
not dream of asking my advice, far less of taking it. But
I am just sending a few lines to Father Anselm, on a—a
little matter of conscience, dear.”</p>

<p>Ludovic knew the peculiar expression of self-conscious
guilt which meant that his mother was embarked upon some
pious course of which she felt certain that her son would
disapprove, and was far from reassured by this simple explanation.</p>

<p>Lady Argent’s mysteries were so transparent, however,
that he felt confident of a speedy enlightenment, but a few
days later she announced that she thought of making a few
days stay in London and of taking Frances with her.</p>

<p>“But why, dear? You know London never suits you.
Is it really necessary?”</p>

<p>“My teeth really do need attention, Ludovic,” faltered his
mother with an intonation which betrayed plainly that however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
much her teeth might require attention they were not
solely responsible for her sudden resolution, even if she had
not immediately added in conscience-stricken accents:</p>

<p>“Not that I want you to think it is only my teeth, though
I have made an appointment with Mr. Fanshawe, because
it seemed such waste not to go there when one was actually
<i>in</i> London, but I do rather want to do one or two other
things besides.”</p>

<p>Ludovic perceived that his mother did not wish him to
have a more intimate knowledge of the one or two other
things, for which he felt sure that the singular number would
have sufficed, and forbore to inquire further.</p>

<p>She took Frances to London the following week, and from
there wrote to her son:</p>

<p>“We went to Twickenham for the day on Sunday, as
Frances was most anxious to see the monastery, and I could
not help longing that she should know Father Anslem. I
left them to have a little talk together while I paid my visit
to the chapel, and the dear child was so very much pleased
with all he said to her.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent, like the majority of women, was always at
her most valiant on paper, and Ludovic rightly conjectured
that she hoped thus to render further allusion to the Twickenham
visit unnecessary. It was therefore not without
some amusement, on the evening that she and Frances returned,
that Ludovic listened to the conversational
manœuvres by which his mother strove to forestall any inconvenient
inquiries.</p>

<p>“And what about Twickenham, dear?” he firmly inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear boy, it was the most freezing day you can
imagine—that very cold Sunday—and altogether so unlike
what one always associated with Twickenham—Twickenham
Ferry, you know, though it’s a song one never hears
nowadays—such a pity, I always think. It makes one think
of straw bonnets and crinolines and so many delightful
things of that kind, which one never meets with now—not
that I can remember crinolines myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“I suppose not, dear, but I want to hear about the monastery,”
said Ludovic inexorably. “What did you think
of the Prior, Miss Frances?”</p>

<p>“I liked him very much. I never saw a monk before, and
he was so much more human and cheerful than I had expected,
somehow.”</p>

<p>“It would not be at all surprising if they were the most
melancholy creatures on earth,” Lady Argent agitatedly
broke in, “at least from a human point of view, because, of
course, want of food and sleep are most dreadfully trying,
and they never have enough of either.”</p>

<p>Frances sat with an awestricken expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s extraordinary to realize that that sort of thing
actually goes on now, at the same time as one’s own ordinary
everyday life,” she said slowly. “I never knew before that
it—religious life, I mean—went on, in that sort of way,
in England nowadays. It always seemed, somehow, so remote—belonging
to medieval times.”</p>

<p>“Like the Inquisition, etc.,” unkindly remarked Ludovic,
with a glance at his mother, whom the allusion always
roused to eloquence.</p>

<p>“That was only a political institution, dear, as you very
well know, and had nothing to do with the Church—at
least the worst part of it hadn’t, and naturally <i>autres temps
autres mœurs</i>, and, besides, it was in Spain, which I never
think is quite the same as other countries, in spite of having
kept the Faith in that marvellous way all these years, which
I believe is the reason they have no days of abstinence there,
but look at the bull-fights and things. Their ideas must be
different to ours, I feel certain.”</p>

<p>“Very different indeed,” dryly remarked Ludovic. “But
please go on about Twickenham. Did you spend the whole
day there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the unconscious Frances. “They gave us
lunch and tea in the guest-house, and showed us all over the
grounds, and we stayed to Benediction in the evening. It
was so nice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Such good music, my dear boy,” said Lady Argent in a
pleading tone of extenuation.</p>

<p>Ludovic refused to attribute the visit to any music, good
or otherwise, but he said no more until he found himself
alone with his mother, who faced him with a mixture of
deprecation and resoluteness in her gaze.</p>

<p>“I know you don’t approve, darling,” she said bravely,
“but the fact was that that poor little dear really <i>requires</i>
some spiritual direction, and I had already written to Father
Anselm about her, and he was so very anxious that I should
put her into the way of being taught something about the
Faith, that it really seemed one’s duty. You see she will be
dreadfully cut off from everything when she gets back to
Porthlew.”</p>

<p>“And what is the Prior going to do? Lend her books?”
said Ludovic, with a most unenthusiastic intonation, and a
vivid recollection of the innumerable devotional manuals of
suggestive titles that were strewn about his mother’s bedroom
and boudoir.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” meekly returned Lady Argent; “and—I
am really afraid you won’t approve at all, Ludovic—but she
is most anxious to be instructed—and really when one remembers
that her mother was a Catholic and everything——”
She paused helplessly.</p>

<p>“You can’t have had her turned into a Catholic already?”</p>

<p>“No—they wouldn’t receive her until she knew more
about it—but Father Anselm is going to give her a course
of instruction by post.”</p>

<p>“Mother, you really are not acting fairly by Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she would mind so very much? After all,
Frances is not her daughter.”</p>

<p>“The point is that she has not been asked. I really think
she has a right to be told, before there is any question of
anything so definite as receiving regular instructions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ludovic, my dear boy! I wish I could get you to
look at it as I do. The gain of a soul, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“The end justifies the means,” quoted Ludovic, shaking
his head and unable to help laughing. “Mother dear, may
I talk to her about it?”</p>

<p>“To Frances? Oh yes, dear, I wish you would. I assure
you that it’s most edifying to see the graces that child has
already been given—she seems to believe by instinct, as it
were. Perhaps,” said Lady Argent with a sort of melancholy
hopefulness, “she may be able to show you things in
quite a new light.”</p>

<p>Ludovic was inclined to think this contingency a remote
one, and it did not deter him from seeking a conversation
with Frances Grantham.</p>

<p>Something unexpectedly flintlike in the quality of her determination
came upon him as a surprise.</p>

<p>“I am going to tell Cousin Bertie all about it,” she said
quietly. “She and Cousin Frederick have the right to be
told, but they have not the right to stop me from following
my own conscience. I am going to become a Catholic as
soon as Father Anselm thinks me sufficiently instructed.”</p>

<p>“And when will that be?”</p>

<p>“He thought in about six or eight months, perhaps. But
he wants to see me again before then.”</p>

<p>“How can you manage that?” asked Ludovic wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I should have to go away, anyhow, to be received.
There is no Catholic Church anywhere very near Porthlew.
And Father Anselm suggests that I should stay at a convent
where they take lady boarders, somewhere between us and
London, as he will be coming down there to give a Retreat,
which I should make.”</p>

<p>She spoke with all the decision of which her gentle tones
were capable, and Ludovic realized that she had very definitely
made up her young mind. He wondered whether the
instinct which he divined to be as strong in her now as in her
twelfth year, of childish obedience and submission, would
revive under contact with the masterful will of Bertha Tregaskis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“Surely your guardian will at least want you to wait until
you are of age?”</p>

<p>“Why should I? Hazel did not wait to be of age to get married.”</p>

<p>Her voice held defiance and Ludovic said gently:</p>

<p>“I am not venturing to condemn your decision. But my
mother has had something to do with furthering it, and she
would be very sorry, as you know, if it meant distress and
difficulties for Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Frances, “I can’t bear to think of it. She
has always been so very good to us, and you know Hazel’s
marriage was a dreadful blow to her—it is still, because
Guy doesn’t let Hazel see much of her—they’ve only been
to Porthlew once, and Cousin Bertie hasn’t even seen the
baby yet. But how can I help it?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t quite the same thing as though she were really
your mother, perhaps,” Ludovic said kindly.</p>

<p>Frances coloured, and the lines of her soft mouth hardened
again.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that. God comes before one’s father or mother.
It would be just as much my duty to become a Catholic now
if all my nearest and dearest were against it. I must do
what I think right.”</p>

<p>In the implacable self-righteousness which Frances mistook
for principle, Ludovic saw his mother’s best ally.</p>

<p>“I do not suppose that she will ever yield, when it comes
to what she thinks is a question of conscience,” he told Lady
Argent that evening, who replied with surprise:</p>

<p>“I am so delighted that you think so, Ludovic. I always
thought she was so very gentle and submissive that perhaps
it would be only too easy for anyone to influence her, which
would be so dreadful, now that she has really had light
given her. Not that I want to judge dear Bertie rashly, but
I am afraid it is quite possible that she may raise difficulties.”</p>

<p>“Quite possible,” Ludovic dryly assented.</p>

<p>It was not altogether without amusement that he foresaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Mrs. Tregaskis engaged in a contest of wills with the youngest
and hitherto most easily dominated of her charges. That
Frances herself anticipated just such a contest was evident,
and Ludovic, almost in spite of himself, wondered whether
she did not view the approaching conflict with more complacency
than she knew.</p>

<p>As her long visit to the Wye Valley drew towards its close,
Frances lost her shyness with Ludovic. Twice he took her
across the valley to the cottage where the earlier years of
her childhood had been spent, and marvelled at the gentle detachment
of the looks she cast round her. Insensitive
Frances could not be, but Ludovic realized afresh that reality,
for her, would never lie on the material planes where
most of us turn instinctively to seek it.</p>

<p>Her reserve once broken, she and Lady Argent would
gently and interminably discuss the subject of conversion
with a soft disregard for his presence and prejudice alike
which almost involuntarily caused Ludovic a good deal of
amusement.</p>

<p>“It would be such a help to you, dear child,” Lady Argent
said on the eve of Frances’ return to Porthlew, “if you
only had some friend quite near, to whom you could talk,
because writing is never quite the same thing, as I found
with Mother Serafina—you know, dear, the nun who did
so much towards my conversion—when she said it was
quite out of the question for her to come and stay here, and
I must write to her instead. Which, of course, I did, and I
still do at Christmas and Easter and any sort of Feast, but
it was a most unsatisfactory correspondence—really most
unsatisfactory.”</p>

<p>“Did the Superior have to read the letters?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, all of them, but she’d told me about that, and
I didn’t mind so much, though it made one a little bit careful,
perhaps, as to what one said. But it wasn’t really so much
what <i>I</i> wrote—though that was awkward enough sometimes,
between not knowing whether one ought to send one’s
love to Reverend Mother, or only ask for her prayers—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
what <i>she</i> wrote. She always signed herself ‘Yours affectionately
in Christ,’ which used to puzzle me dreadfully. (I
was still a Protestant in those days),” said Lady Argent in
an explanatory parenthesis. “And I used to wonder so very
much whether she expected me to sign myself ‘Yours affectionately
in Christ’ back again. It seemed so very unnatural
if I did, and yet so very marked if I didn’t, as
though my affection for her was quite a worldly sort of
thing. And then, dear, she always had a long string of letters
after her signature—Mary Serafina, and then ‘Mother’
in brackets and a little cross and P.R.O.S.A., which I used
to think for a long time must be Latin, you know—something
like ‘Prosit,’ whatever that may mean, only feminine,
because it ended with <i>a</i>.”</p>

<p>“And what was it really?” asked Frances, evidently rejecting
this plausible hypothesis.</p>

<p>“My dear, I believe it stands for Professed Religious of
the Order of St. Anthony. I quite see that it was very
stupid of me not to have thought of it at once, but little
things like that puzzle one so much at the beginning, and
one doesn’t like to ask. That is why I was suggesting,” said
Lady Argent, ingeniously finding her way back to her original
point of departure, “that it would be a help to you if
only you had some Catholic friend to whom you could go—or,
if that is quite impossible, to whom you could write.”</p>

<p>“There is always Mrs. Severing,” suggested Frances
rather faintly.</p>

<p>Lady Argent looked markedly unenthusiastic, but only
remarked in tones of forbearance that Mrs. Severing was
not a Catholic.</p>

<p>“I think she will become one, don’t you?” said Frances,
but there was no conviction in her voice.</p>

<p>“No doubt it is as it will be, dear,” Lady Argent replied
with cryptic charitableness. “But what I had thought of
for you, was to put you in touch with the Superior of the
Convent at Plymouth. She is a dear friend of mine, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
particularly fond of girls. They have a big school there, I
dare say you have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“It’s very well known, dear, because the girls there always
distinguish themselves in all the Oxford locals and examinations
and things in the most remarkable manner. It is
really very curious indeed, when there is such a prejudice
against a convent education, but the girls always do better
than the high-school girls. The Superior told me so herself.”</p>

<p>“How nice!” cried Frances in perfect sincerity.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, and it really is wonderful, because I know the
dear children always wear a special medal of the Holy Ghost
when they go to their examinations, so it really is quite wonderful,”
repeated Lady Argent, who, in common with many
other devout souls, would frequently issue meticulous and
childlike petitions to Heaven, and then express the greatest
astonishment when these requests were acceded to.</p>

<p>“And you see, dear, if you could write quite freely to the
Superior it seems to me it would be such a very great help
to you, and you needn’t feel that the letters wouldn’t be quite
private, because, being the Superior, of course nobody else
reads her letters.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for thinking of it,” said Frances
gratefully. “If Cousin Bertie lets me, I should like it very
much. You see, I don’t want to vex her more than I can
help, and I don’t think she’ll like my writing to Father
Anselm much—but that, of course, is a matter of conscience.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Ludovic that those three words, as uttered
by Frances, would probably be responsible for more numerous
and deeper dissensions than any that the house of Tregaskis
had yet known.</p>

<p>The next morning he drove Frances to the station. Lady
Argent kissed her guest very affectionately as she bade her
good-bye, gave her a rosary which had been blessed first by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Father Anselm and eventually by Pope Leo XIII., and said
earnestly:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my dearest child, and do write to me and let
me know how you get on, and what dear Bertie thinks,
though kind and understanding I <i>know</i> she’ll be, and the
grace of God will do the rest, I feel certain. You must
come again whenever you like, for we love having you,
though I know it’s a most awkward journey for you, dear,
and I only hope you’ll not have too long a wait when you
change at Bristol. Have you got your sandwiches, dear?”</p>

<p>Ludovic cut short his parent’s farewells, knowing from
experience that they were apt to result in a narrow escape
from missing the train altogether, and Frances drove away
from the Wye Valley.</p>

<p>“I shall be interested to hear of further developments at
Porthlew,” Ludovic said to his mother that evening. “That
little girl is a curious mixture of timidity and determination.
I wonder what her sister will think of this?”</p>

<p>“There is only one thing anyone can think, darling,”
serenely returned Lady Argent, “and that is how very good
God has been to that dear child, and I feel sure that He has
a number of graces in store for her, for she is so wonderfully
good and holy already.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” gently replied Ludovic.</p>

<p>“I shall miss her,” wistfully said Lady Argent, and added
after a silence:</p>

<p>“My dearest boy, I do wish you would find some nice
Catholic girl and marry her.”</p>

<p>Ludovic had heard this aspiration before, and felt no
desire to comply with it.</p>

<p>“I’m quite happy as I am, mother darling,” he told her
gently. “Besides, I don’t believe any nice Catholic girl
would have me—a bald-headed heretic with a crutch.
Now I must do a little writing, and you can say a rosary for
my conversion. You know that’s what you always <i>do</i> say it
for.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, it is, and one of these days when you least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
expect it, that prayer will be answered,” predicted his mother
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“We shall see. You’d better be content with your latest
conversion, for the time being. I’m sure it will knock at
least five hundred years off your purgatory, as soon as it’s a
<i>fait accompli</i>.”</p>

<p>But that the reception of Frances Grantham into the Catholic
Church was not to become a <i>fait accompli</i> without some
previous difficulty, soon became abundantly evident.</p>

<p>Frances did not prove to be a good correspondent, but
Lady Argent received one or two letters from her, of which
she imparted the contents to Ludovic, and then came a
lengthy epistle from Bertha Tregaskis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dearest Sybil, you have been such an angel to my little
girl that I make no apology for thrusting her affairs—and
my own—upon you. The fact is, the child is perfectly
<i>entichée</i> with matters religious at the moment, and declares
that only the Roman Catholic faith will do for her. You
won’t misunderstand me if I confess that, if Frances were
my own child, I should take away all her little holy books
and ornaments in the midst of which she sits like a young
virgin-martyr, and forbid her to speak of the subject again
for at least a year. We should then see how much of it was
an emotional craze, and how much genuine stuff. But the
facts that she is not <i>quite</i> my own flesh and blood, and that
her own mother did, in actual point of fact, belong to your
Faith, make rather a difference. As Frederick says, we
have no actual authority over the child, and one hesitates as
to how far coercion may be desirable in such a case. Frederick,
man-like, refuses to discuss the subject with anybody—what
cowards men are! ‘’Usbands be proper fules for
the most part, and us dü arl the yead work for both,’ as one
of my old women said to me the other day!</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, the upshot of it all is, am I to let the
child go to this convent at Easter, where she wants to make
a Ladies’ Retreat—whatever that may be—and, I suppose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
eventually be received into the Catholic Church? Can
you tell me anything about this convent, what sort of a
woman the Reverend Mother is, and what sort of people she
will come across there? I shall send poor Minnie Blandflower
with her, if I let her go at all.</p>

<p>“This is a proper ole yarn, isn’t it, but I rely on you to
understand that I only want what is best for Francie, and
am writing to you, since I know you’re fond of the child, and
can probably advise me as to the convent and other particulars.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Dear Bertie is most kind-hearted and charitable, isn’t
she?” said Lady Argent, “and of course I can write and tell
her anything she wants to know about the convent. How
very glad I am that dear little Frances is going there! but
I wish Bertie would send her sister with her, as well as Miss
Blandflower.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Miss Rosamund is at all inclined to be
interested in religion for its own sake, somehow,” returned
Ludovic, rightly divining that his mother viewed Miss Blandflower
and Rosamund alike in the light of possible fish for
the convent net.</p>

<p>Lady Argent murmured that the grace of God was very
wonderful, and you couldn’t tell at all, and then returned to
her correspondence.</p>

<p>“Father Anselm writes that he is very much pleased with
her dispositions,” she presently observed, looking up from
a letter.</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Ludovic, feeling oddly out of charity with
the members of religious orders generally, and the Prior of
Twickenham in particular.</p>

<p>He speculated often during the next few months as to
events at Porthlew, and their effect upon Rosamund and
Frances Grantham, but he was much in London and heard
little news of them.</p>

<p>It was just before Easter-time that his mother triumphantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
told him that the date for Frances’ visit to the convent
was arranged for the following week.</p>

<p>“And I can’t tell you, my dear boy, what a relief it is to
me after all the correspondence there has been with dear
Bertie, and Father Anselm, and the poor child herself,
who never wavered at all, but one couldn’t help feeling
that at any moment she might begin to wonder whether it
wasn’t her duty to do as Bertie advised, and wait. So fatal
in a question of religion, I always think. And it would have
been dreadful to see dear little Frances one of those shilly-shallying
souls, never either quite in or quite out of the
Church,” said Lady Argent, in a voice which had become,
to Ludovic’s perceptions, charged with reminiscences of
Nina Severing.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202;’M an impulsive creature,” declared Bertha, in despite
of the protesting eyebrows which Mrs. Severing
instantly erected at the assertion. “It was an impulse
that made me allow Francie to accept Sybil Argent’s
invitation, and I don’t mind owning that it was a mistaken
one. The child came back more tiresomely self-righteous
than she went, and now—as you know—we’ve practically
consented to the whole business.”</p>

<p>“Of course, darling,” said Nina tenderly, “I do <i>not</i> look
upon it in the light that you do, but at the same time, you
know, if I had once said <i>no</i> to a child of mine, <i>no</i> it should
remain. Nothing is more fatal than a half-consent, to my
mind.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Nina. And when does Morris come home, may
I ask?” said Bertha acidly, and had the satisfaction of seeing
her friend colour faintly, as she replied with what both
of them knew to be more spirit than sincerity:</p>

<p>“Any time, now. I expect him from day to day, practically.
But a young man is a very different matter to a
little girl, Bertie, though perhaps only we mothers of sons
really appreciate that.”</p>

<p>Bertha changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Frances goes to this convent next week, when they
appear to be giving a Retreat of some sort, and after that I
suppose she’ll become an R.C. outright. As Frederick says,
we’re not in a position actually to forbid it, so we may as
well make the best of it. I hate making a compromise, and
yet, since the children grew up, I’ve been doing nothing else,
it seems to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Poor dear! But I’m sure it’ll be better for everyone
when the child’s actually taken a decisive step. She’ll be
much more settled afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Settled in the wrong direction!” sighed Bertha. “However,
she’s always been a good little thing, and except for
this unfortunate fancy, we’ve never had any difficulties. So
unlike poor Rosamund! As Frederick says, it’s the only
form of self-will Frances has ever shown, and though she is
obstinate, it isn’t quite the same thing as Rosamund’s constant
perversity.”</p>

<p>“A fit of religion might be no bad thing for <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree—but there isn’t a sign of it. Frances
suggested her making this Retreat affair too, but she
wouldn’t hear of it—fortunately enough, perhaps, since I
should certainly have had to put my foot down. I shall have
to send poor Minnie with Frances, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Let me take her!” suddenly exclaimed Nina, with an air
of self-abnegation. “I have been thinking of making a
Retreat for some time.”</p>

<p>Bertha was as well aware as Nina herself that “some
time” only covered the last five seconds of time, but the
advantages of Nina’s suggestion were too obvious for her
to point out any flaws in the proposal.</p>

<p>“But, my dear, should you like it? A whole week at a
place of that sort, and nothing on earth to do!”</p>

<p>“To ‘make my soul,’ Bertie. It would be such a rest—such
a help. Not the teachings and sermonizings, you know,
but quiet hours to myself in the garden and the chapel, a
little time to read and meditate....”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Nina. You don’t mean to become
a Roman Catholic, so what’s the fun of dabbling in
it?”</p>

<p>Nina understood that the unnecessary bluntness in her
friend’s phraseology had been brought there by a certain
rapt dreaminess of which she was fully conscious in her own
expression.</p>

<p>“Dear Bertie,” she said softly, “it is quite true that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
<i>can’t</i> be bound by any of the conventional laws of religion,
but mayn’t I seek comfort where I can best find it?”</p>

<p>Bertha became, if possible, more matter-of-fact than before,
in antagonistic contrast to this soulful appeal.</p>

<p>“You know they charge for your board and lodging at
these places?”</p>

<p>Nina’s tinkling laugh pealed protestingly.</p>

<p>“My dear, how desperately practical you always are!
It’s positively comic. Do you know, that I’m sometimes
tempted to think that you and I represent the two
types——”</p>

<p>“Martha and Mary,” Bertha unkindly forestalled her
friend’s seasoned witticism. “I know, dear, though perhaps
there’s a good deal more of the Mary in me than you
suppose—but I know it’s difficult to judge of people who
have the misfortune to be as reserved as I am. However,
if you really have taken a fancy to this scheme, by all means
let Francie go with you. I shall be only too delighted, and
it will be a relief to Minnie.”</p>

<p>“Poor Miss Blandflower! I can’t quite see her in a
convent atmosphere, I admit.”</p>

<p>“<i>Qu’ allait-elle faire dans cette galère</i>,” hummed Bertha.</p>

<p>Nina, who did not like Bertha’s admirable French accent,
immediately gave a small excruciated shriek.</p>

<p>“Out of tune, my dear! You were at least a semitone
out—<i>Aic!</i>”</p>

<p>The annoyance which is common to everybody when
accused, whether falsely or otherwise, of singing out of tune,
was evident on Bertha’s broad, good-humoured face, and
went some way towards consoling Nina for a rather impulsive
decision.</p>

<p>Some few days later, she and Frances Grantham went
together to the convent.</p>

<p>“I’m glad the Retreat doesn’t begin till the day after
to-morrow,” said Frances rather nervously, as they waited
outside the tall, narrow building, situated at the extreme
end of the small provincial town. “It will give us time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
get used to everything, and perhaps to know one or two of
the nuns.”</p>

<p>“The Superior’s letter to me was charming,” said Nina
firmly, “quite charming, and I almost feel as though I knew
her already. Somehow one has a sort of <i>awareness</i> of anyone
with whom one is in tune, don’t you think so? It’s almost
a sense of recognition.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Severing’s recognition of Mère Pauline, however,
did not appear likely to progress beyond this initial stage for
some time after a very aged lay-sister in a black veil and
habit had conducted the travellers into a large and plainly
furnished parlour, and left them to await the Superior’s arrival.</p>

<p>“Can we have mistaken the date?” asked Nina, when a
quarter of an hour had elapsed and their solitude still remained
undisturbed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is very busy, if a lot of people are arriving
to make the Retreat,” suggested Frances doubtfully.</p>

<p>They exchanged surmises at intervals for another ten
minutes.</p>

<p>“Do open the door, Francie,” said Nina at last in annoyed
accents. “That stupid old sister must have forgotten us.”</p>

<p>Frances rather unwillingly looked into the dark, narrow
passage.</p>

<p>A couple of girls with black lace veils pinned over untidy
hair, and falling incongruously across plaid blouses, were
skirmishing and giggling at one end of the corridor. They
broke off as Frances opened the door and at the same instant
one of them exclaimed:</p>

<p>“<i>Chut! Notre Mère!</i>”</p>

<p>A very small, black-clad figure advanced through a further
door, and Frances, hurriedly retreating, was in time to see
the two girls make a sort of subdued dash towards her which
the Superior put aside with a gentle but very decided little
movement of the hand, and “<i>Pas ici, mes enfants</i>.”</p>

<p>The next moment she came into the parlour.</p>

<p>Mère Pauline was an exceedingly small, upright person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
with black eyes to which a pair of large round spectacles
gave an air of inquiry, a hooked nose, and a thin, decided
little mouth. She spoke English fluently, although with the
unmistakable accent and intonation of a Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Severing?” she inquired of Nina. “I am very
glad to see you—and this is Lady Argent’s little friend. I
may call you Frances, dear? I ’ave ’eard so much about
you. ’Ow nice to see you ’ere.”</p>

<p>Like the majority of her countrywomen, she altogether
ignored the letter H.</p>

<p>After a few moments’ conversation, the nun offered to
show her visitors to their bedrooms.</p>

<p>“We have not much room,” she said smilingly, preceding
them up a long flight of narrow stairs. “The house is full
of ladies who are come for the Retreat, as well as all our
permanent lady boarders.”</p>

<p>“Have you many?” inquired Nina, panting slightly from
the ascent, which Mère Pauline was conducting with a sort
of businesslike rapidity.</p>

<p>“Six or seven who are permanently at home here, and
then a number which is always varying, of young girls
whose parents have confided them to us for a time to learn
English. They are for the most part Spanish, or French.
They have given up their rooms for the Retreat, and have
moved upstairs into the piano-cells,” said Mère Pauline serenely.</p>

<p>She stopped before a door where a neat card was pinned
with Mrs. Severing’s name upon it. Just above it, a red-bordered
scroll proclaimed in Gothic lettering “Ste.
Perpétue.”</p>

<p>“I have put you into Ste. Perpétue as it has a very nice
aspect,” announced the Superior, “and Frances is next door—St.
Félicitée. You see, you can look out upon our little
piece of garden.”</p>

<p>She advanced into the room, which was a very small and
narrow one, with distempered green walls, a low iron bed-stead,
a washing-stand and minute chest-of-drawers combined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
a straw-bottomed chair and one strip of faded carpet
beside the bed. A plaster crucifix and a blue china holy-water
stoup hung against the wall. Underneath stood the
only concession to worldly requirements that the room contained—a
looking-glass framed in wood, placed upon a tall
packing-case indifferently disguised by a white and beautifully
darned cotton cover.</p>

<p>The slight shade of dismay which had crossed Nina’s
face on entering, gave way almost instantly to a suitable
expression of enchantment, as she exclaimed in low, heartfelt
tones:</p>

<p>“A convent cell! Ah, how I have dreamed of finding
myself in one.”</p>

<p>If Mère Pauline failed to see the applicability of this description
to one of her most cherished guest-chambers, she
made no sign of it, but merely proceeded to conduct Frances
into the exactly similar room adjoining.</p>

<p>“I hope you will be very happy here, dear child,” she said
kindly, “and that we shall have many little talks later on.
The Retreat does not begin till to-morrow night, so you
will have time to look about you.”</p>

<p>“I thought it began the day after to-morrow,” said
Frances.</p>

<p>“So it does, but you will enter into silence on the previous
night,” said the Superior. “But here is our programme
awaiting you.”</p>

<p>She picked up a small leaflet, neatly written out in violet
ink, from the washing-stand, which also appeared destined
to fulfil the ordinary functions of a table, and left her guests
to study it, with the warning that a bell would shortly summon
them to supper in the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Supper at six o’clock!” exclaimed Nina. “What an
extraordinary hour. I wonder if we have it with the nuns.”</p>

<p>“I think the community live in a different part of the
house altogether,” said Frances diffidently, “and I’m sure
we don’t have meals with them.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“I’ve been reading one or two lives of nuns lately—Lady
Argent lent me some,” murmured Frances, and hastily
changed the conversation by beginning to read aloud from
the purple leaflet.</p>

</div>

<p>“I’m not sure how far it will be wise to follow the
routine,” said Nina rather languidly. “I certainly can’t
meditate to order. But no doubt these rules are only for the
girls she was speaking about, and have nothing to do with
visitors.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I like the idea of rules,” said Frances quickly.
“It’s such a help to do things regularly, it seems to me, and
all together.”</p>

<p>“Ah, little one, you are still child enough to feel it so.
When one is as tired and heavy-hearted as I am sometimes....”</p>

<p>Perhaps Nina was not altogether sorry that a violent bell-ringing
interrupted these mournful reflections without allowing
time for their completion.</p>

<p>“How shall we find the dining-room?” said Frances, preparing
to descend the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“There can’t be very many rooms to choose from, in such
a small house. I wonder what their idea of dinner may be—or
supper, I suppose one ought to call it. Not bread and
water, I do trust.”</p>

<p>Nina’s gloomy forebodings were not realized. The meal
was abundant and not badly cooked, from potato soup to
hashed mutton and cabinet pudding.</p>

<p>A rather formidable-looking old lady of immense size,
with the inevitable black veil on her scanty white hair,
and a bristling moustache adorning her upper lip, sat at
the head of the long table. Opposite her was a stout Spanish
girl who might have been of any age between eighteen
and thirty-five, with oily-looking plaits of black hair coiled
flatly against each ear. The intervening places were for the
most part filled with black-clad, creaking ladies of uncertain
years, each one of whom was either extremely fat or abnormally
thin, and a sprinkling of French and Spanish girls in
brightly coloured blouses with the black veil either pinned on
to each <i>chignon</i> or flung scarf-wise over the shoulders.</p>

<p>A young English nun greeted the new-comers as they
made their rather tardy appearance.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Severing, isn’t it—and Miss Grantham? Just in
time for supper. Will you sit here, Mrs. Severing, next to
Mrs. Mulholland?”</p>

<p>The mountainous Mrs. Mulholland bowed ceremoniously
from her seat at the head of the table.</p>

<p>“And you’ll sit here, dear, next to your friend,” the nun
continued to Frances. “Now you must all make acquaintance
as quickly as you can, since by this time to-morrow
there’ll be no more talking and the opportunity will be gone.”</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at this pleasantry, in which the
nun herself joined heartily as she left the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland turned to Nina Severing.</p>

<p>“This is the first time you’ve been here, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We’ve just come for the Retreat.”</p>

<p>“I have followed the Retreat here every year,” said Mrs.
Mulholland triumphantly, “for the last eighteen years. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
haven’t missed one of them. Poor Monseigneur Miller,
who used always to give it, used to say that he couldn’t have
given out the points for the meditations if he hadn’t seen me
at my own <i>prie-dieu</i>, in my own corner of the Chapel. Did
you ever meet Monseigneur Miller?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not. You see I’m not——”</p>

<p>“Ah well! he’s been dead more than ten years, and we’ve
had several priests for the Ladies’ Retreat since then. Last
year we had Father Aloysius Paxton—a Jesuit. His note
was <i>Repentance</i>—the whole Retreat was Repentance—based
on that, practically. Now I hear that this man, who is
coming to-morrow, takes quite a different line. Wasn’t it
you, Miss Benjafield, who told me that Father Anselm
preaches his retreats altogether in the spirit of Hope?”</p>

<p>“So my sister tells me, Mrs. Mulholland,” replied an
anæmic-looking woman from the other side of the table.
“My Carmelite sister, you know, not the Poor Clare one.
Pass the potatoes, if you please. Thank you. Yes, he gave
them a Retreat which they liked very much, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Mulholland condescendingly. “The
Carmelites make a longer Retreat than ours, I know. I dare
say it’s quite in accordance with the spirit of the Order, but
I must say, what’s good enough for <i>our</i> Order is good enough
for me. I always tell Mère Pauline that an eight-day Retreat
wouldn’t be at all too much for us—it’s what the nuns
make themselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Mulholland! <i>I</i> think five days is quite enough
to keep silence for!” cried a merry-looking French girl, with
an air of saying something audacious.</p>

<p>“Ah, we have to make allowances for you young things.
But I always make up for it later in the year, by coming to
the meditations in the chapel given for the nuns’ Retreat,
you know. Of course,” said Mrs. Mulholland, slightly lowering
her voice and turning towards Nina, “Mère Pauline
doesn’t allow the ladies to follow the nuns’ Retreat <i>at all</i> as
a rule; it’s quite an exception. But, of course, I’ve been
here a number of years, and am almost like one of themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
in a way. I have a very regular rule of life—under direction,
of course, under direction.”</p>

<p>The other ladies, who were evidently well used to the
recital of Mrs. Mulholland’s spiritual privileges, resumed
conversation briskly among themselves and speculations as
to the coming Retreat mingled with the emphatically related
anecdotes of the younger girls as to sudden and disconcerting
encounters with Mère Pauline—“<i>Just</i> as I was saying
that I didn’t think I’d go to Vespers to-day. <i>Do</i> you think
she heard, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I must introduce you all round after supper,” said Mrs.
Mulholland, looking amiably at Nina. “You see, I’m quite
the oldest inhabitant here—in point of stay. I’ve sat at
the head of this table, Mrs. Severing, for the past fifteen
years—ever since poor old Miss O’Malley died. She used
to sit here when I first came—she’d been here for twenty
years, and was a sister of one of the old nuns—but she
took to her own room some six months before she died, and I
was asked to come to the head of the table in her place, and
there I’ve been ever since. I was asked to take it, mind you.
The Superior before this one, Mère Alphonsine, who was
alive then, asked me herself to take the head of the table.
‘<i>Vous dirigerez un peu la conversation</i>,’ she said to me. I
like the conversation at the ladies’ table to be edifying—as
cheerful as you please—but edifying. No grumbling—no
gossip—no uncharitable speaking. So that’s my little task—<i>one</i>
of my little tasks—to keep up the tone of the conversation
at meals. Now a few years ago, Mrs. Severing, we
had Lady O’Hagan here—a very nice woman indeed—widow
of Sir Patrick O’Hagan, of whom you may have
heard—a very well-known Catholic family. Well, the lay-sister
who waits on us here, put Lady O’Hagan at the head
of the table, and moved my place to the side. An ignorant
lay-sister, you see, very well-meaning, but thought that because
of the title this good woman should be put at the head.
‘Now,’ I said, ‘Lady O’Hagan is only here for a few days’—just
for a Retreat she’d come—‘and it doesn’t matter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
me—I’ve got my position here, have had for years—it
<i>doesn’t matter to me</i>. But it is what it ought to be? Mère
Alphonsine asked me to take the head of the table—well
and good—I took it. I’ve had it ever since. If you ask
me, I don’t think I ought to give it up. Mère Alphonsine
had her reasons for putting me there, and there I consider I
ought to stay until I’m told otherwise. Of course, one word
from the Superior and I move at once. That’s obedience.
I’m not under vows, Mrs. Severing, but I consider myself
just as much bound to obedience as any postulant in the
house. Well, I spoke to Mère Econome—she’s by way
of looking after the ladies—and she, being Spanish, didn’t
quite understand the case. Thought it didn’t matter—only
a question of a few days—and so on. ‘That’s not right,’
said I. ‘That’s not the point,’ I said. ‘The point is, <i>what
ought to be</i>.’ So I went straight to Mère Pauline. Straight
to the Superior—that’s my motto, Mrs. Severing. Always
go straight to the Superior. I said: ‘It’s not a question of
minding—I’ll move my place to-morrow if that’s what you
think best,’ I said, ‘but let it be under obedience. A question
of obedience,’ I said, ‘and you’re given the grace to
carry it out.’ That’s all I said: ‘A question of obedience,’
I said.</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Mulholland,’ Mère Pauline said, ‘I should be very
much distressed indeed to think of your moving. Please
stay where you’ve always been, and remember that we look
to you to raise the tone of conversation and render it all it
should be.’ Now, after that, Mrs. Severing, do you wonder
that I look upon my place here as a duty—as a positive responsibility?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Nina rather faintly.</p>

<p>“We’ve always been very careful, of course, as to the
ladies we receive here,” continued Mrs. Mulholland, as usual
identifying herself with the community. “There’s never
any question of gossip, you know—anything of that sort.
But, of course, with so many young people—foreigners too—one
must keep a lookout—just a lookout. There’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
sometimes a little criticizing—a remark or two passed: ‘I
don’t like Mother So-and-So’—‘Sister this or Sister the
other is too sharp in her manner for me.’ Now that’s what
I am here to stop. ‘That’ll do, my dear,’ I say. ‘That’s
enough.’ Never more than that, you know—only ‘That’ll
do, my dear,’ just like that. ‘We don’t find fault with the
nuns here,’ I say. ‘You must go somewhere else if you
want a spirit of disloyalty. We don’t stock it here.’ Passing
it off, you see, with a joke. That’s all I ever say, and I
assure you it’s always been efficacious.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it has,” began Nina again. “Do you——”</p>

<p>“We’re quite a large party here for the moment owing to
the Retreat, but, of course, at other times it’s more like a
family—there’s not the same necessity,” pursued Mrs. Mulholland,
warming to her theme, “for keeping a sharp eye
open—or perhaps I ought to say a sharp ear.” She paused
to laugh heartily. “I don’t want to give you the impression
that I am a sort of policeman, waiting to pounce, Mrs. Severing,
or you’ll be afraid to open your lips. We’re all very
glad, on the contrary, to see a new face now and then, and
hear something fresh. Though I always tell Mère Pauline
that I think we ladies ought to have a rule of silence at
meals, just as the community has. That’s what <i>I</i> should
like.”</p>

<p>The fervour of this aspiration was only equalled by the
intensity with which it was inwardly echoed by Mrs.
Severing.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the meal drew towards a close two or three of the
girls began to push back their chairs, murmuring to
their neighbours: “Well—if you’ll excuse me,”
and left the room after a rapid Sign of the Cross, apparently
directed at the centre of the table. Mrs. Mulholland inclined
her monumental bulk over her empty plate for a few
seconds, crossed herself devoutly two or three times, and
then said rather majestically to Nina Severing:</p>

<p>“If you care to go over the house and garden a little later
on, you must come to my room. On the ground floor, the
first door you see at the end of that passage. It’s been my
room for eighteen years. It’s a great joke in the community
that I’ve been here longer than Mère Pauline has—several
years longer. I was here in the time of Mère Alphonsine—a
great saint, Mère Alphonsine—ah, yes, indeed. Not that I
mean to say Mère Pauline isn’t a saint in her own way, you
know, but of course there it is. I remember her arrival here
as a young nun who’d not yet taken her final vows. I was
here for her profession fifteen years ago. I often chaff her
about it, you know, ‘Ah, notre Mère,’ I say, ‘remember I
was here before you were.’ It’s quite a household joke, I
assure you. ‘Mrs. Mulholland was here before you were,’
the nuns say. I believe it’s quite a catchword at the community
recreations. Now let me show you my room, Mrs.
Severing; you must learn to find your way here, you know.
<i>La mère des Dames—pensionnaires</i>, the lay-sisters call me.
That’s right, Miss Grantham—come right in.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland waved a hospitable hand at Frances, who
accepted the invitation with the more diffidence that the
small room appeared strangely crowded already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>A little table in the window was laden with books grouped
at the foot of an immense crucifix, devotional pictures, and
slender brackets on which were balanced perilously-poised
statuettes plastered the wall, a holy-water stoup slung with
rosaries decorated the door, and fragments of dried palm
tied with red ribbon hung crosswise over the bed. Below
this came yet another crucifix and a large framed scroll-work
announcing the reception of Mary-Theresa Aloysia
Leaky into the Sodality of the Children of Mary some fifty
odd years ago. A bulging curtain in an angle of the wall
evidently sheltered Mrs. Mulholland’s wardrobe, of which
the surplus appeared to be housed in variously shaped and
sized card-board boxes with defective lids, that could be seen
under the bed and stacked in corners.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” cried the owner of the room cordially, and
thrust upon Mrs. Severing’s notice the small rush chair
which was the only one she appeared to possess.</p>

<p>“Miss Grantham won’t mind a seat on the bed.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we really mustn’t stay,” began Nina, who
had been wearing her celebrated resemblance to a hothouse
flower buffeted by rude winds for some time, and was not
best pleased at its utter absence of effect.</p>

<p>A bell clanged two strokes and then three. Mrs. Mulholland,
who had just sunk heavily on to the foot of the bed,
heaved herself up again with an air of startled attention and
stood listening.</p>

<p>“There! What did I tell you?” she peremptorily inquired
of Frances. “That’s Mother Juliana’s bell, and she
won’t be able to hear it. I happen to know that she’s in the
chapel at this very moment. I suppose she’s wanted for the
parlour again, but evidently the sister doesn’t know she’s in
the chapel.”</p>

<p>The bell, regardless of Mrs. Mulholland, inexorably
clanged out a second summons similar to the first.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of ringing like that? She <i>can’t</i> hear it
if she’s in the chapel. I see what it is—I shall have to go
and tell her myself. Dear, dear, this <i>is</i> a business,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Mrs. Mulholland, opening the door with a careworn expression
of importance.</p>

<p>Nina instantly took the opportunity of escaping, and
imperatively signed to Frances to do likewise. They followed
Mrs. Mulholland down the passage, still listening to
the confidences which she imparted over her shoulder in a
hoarse, sibilant whisper.</p>

<p>“Mother Juliana is the infirmarian—regular as clockwork
as a rule—one always knows just where to find her
at this hour. But I happen to know that to-day’s an exception.
I happen to know she’s had to make her spiritual reading
now, instead of at four o’clock. Nothing very serious,
you know, but just a little alteration in the routine, of which
I happened to know. Just hark at that bell! Evidently no
one knows where to find her. Fortunately, as it chanced,
I just happen to know she’s here....”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland paused with evident enjoyment outside
the green baize door leading to the chapel, gathered her
ample black skirts tightly round her with one hand, and
advanced with elaborate creakings, on the tips of her toes,
leaving the swing-door open behind her.</p>

<p>Frances and Nina both gazed into the pretty softly-lighted
chapel, with the low carven stalls where knelt an occasional
black-robed figure. Rows of light oak benches occupied the
back half of the little church, and were evidently destined
for the occupation of visitors to the convent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland, on the threshold, startled them both
by wheeling abruptly round and proffering a liberally-splashed
finger from the marble shell containing holy water
at the door.</p>

<p>Neither Nina nor Frances had presence of mind to avail
themselves of the opportunity thus suddenly thrust upon
them, and Mrs. Mulholland, erecting her eyebrows with an
expression of regret, resumed her cautious progress in the
direction of a devoutly-bent form kneeling in the first stall.</p>

<p>As she sank heavily on her knees on to the floor and
began a rapid and hoarsely whispered conversation, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
the black veil punctuated by an occasional inclination, Nina
murmured hastily to Frances:</p>

<p>“Come upstairs again before she gets out. I can’t stand
any more of this!”</p>

<p>They fled noiselessly.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Nina in the sanctuary of her own room,
which now appeared to her as a veritable haven of refuge,
“if this is what they call the peace of convent life....”</p>

<p>“It will be silence after to-morrow,” said Frances consolingly.</p>

<p>“I long for it,” murmured Mrs. Severing, who had never
before made the aspiration with such perfect sincerity.</p>

<p>“You look so tired. Do lie down and let me unpack for
you.”</p>

<p>“Darling child!” cried Nina, sinking on to the bed, “I
shouldn’t dream of letting you do such a thing. Why
should you? Oh, don’t pull at the straps like that, dearest.
My keys are in that little bag there.”</p>

<p>Frances unpacked.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this operation there was a knock at
the door, and a smiling old lay-sister remarked triumphantly:</p>

<p>“Mère Pauline is waiting to see you in the little parlour
downstairs, dear. Come along.”</p>

<p>Nina rose with languid grace.</p>

<p>“No, no, dear,” said the lay-sister, still smiling. “It’s
this child.” She laid her hand on Frances’ arm. “You’re
the little one that’s to be received into Holy Church after
Easter, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” stammered Frances.</p>

<p>“Come along, dear, then. I dare say,” she added consolingly
over her shoulder to Nina, “that Mère Pauline will
be able to spare you a little while of her time during the
Retreat, you know.”</p>

<p>The outraged Mrs. Severing was left to her own reflections
for the next two hours.</p>

<p>“What <i>have</i> you been doing?” she demanded plaintively
of Frances on her return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Frances’ colour was heightened and her eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Mère Pauline stayed with me in the parlour for quite a
long time, and was so very kind and understanding—I’d
never met anyone who understood things so well—and then
she took me into the chapel. And then, just as I was coming
up again, a sister told me that Father Anselm Windsor
was here, and had asked to see me. You know I met him
at the Twickenham Monastery when Lady Argent took me
there, and he is instructing me.”</p>

<p>“So you had an extra catechism lesson!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t exactly that,” said Frances simply. “He just
talked to me very kindly, and explained a little about the
Retreat, and I asked him if I couldn’t be received into the
Church now. I think they will let me, at the end of the Retreat.”</p>

<p>Frances went to her own room that evening in a sort of
dreamy happiness that was yet more poignant than any her
short life had yet known. A sense of security, of having
found some long-sought atmosphere of rest, pervaded her.</p>

<p>She was only roused from the lengthy and ardent thanksgiving
which she was offering upon her knees when Mrs.
Severing softly opened the door, retreating again as she
perceived Frances’ attitude of devotion, but murmuring as
she went:</p>

<p>“A most amusing thought has just struck me, Francie.
These sweet nuns live so much out of the world, and are so
much wrapped up in their prayers and things, that I dare
say poor Mère Pauline doesn’t even know <i>who I am</i>.”</p>

<p>If Mrs. Severing, however, supposed that the revelation of
her identity with the composer of the “Kismet” series
would operate a startling change in Mère Pauline’s outlook,
she was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>That imperturbable woman, when confronted next day
with the casual announcement that Nina had composed “a
certain amount of church music, as well as the more or less
well-known songs, which had really made one’s name, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
course,” merely replied with perfect placidity, and a smile
that was rather encouraging than admiring:</p>

<p>“<i>Aha? C’est gentil!</i>”</p>

<p>“That dear nun is really positively medieval!” was Mrs.
Severing’s exasperated inward ejaculation after receiving
this commentary upon her life-work.</p>

<p>But it was not Nina’s way to leave any possible stone unturned
in the direction of obtaining that sympathetic admiration
which she felt her nature to require.</p>

<p>“I came here to seek a little peace—a little forgetfulness,”
was her next effort, this time in the vein of resigned
pathos. “Ah, mother, you who live such a sheltered life—so
free from trouble and temptation, can hardly guess what
sorrows there are in the world.”</p>

<p>“Every life has its trials,” rather austerely replied Mère
Pauline, not improbably reckoning the dissection of Mrs.
Severing’s soul amongst these latter.</p>

<p>“I married very, very young—a child—and was left
alone so early, with another child to guide and bring up. I
have a son, you know.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? That must be a great consolation to you,
madame.”</p>

<p>“Not altogether,” sighed Nina truthfully. “There are
sorrows of which a mother does not speak.”</p>

<p>Mère Pauline appearing more nearly disposed to conform
to this axiom than was altogether desirable, Nina was obliged
to add hastily:</p>

<p>“But you will let me speak freely to you? Mine is a
terribly reserved nature, and for so many years I have kept
everything to myself.”</p>

<p>“Speak, madame, speak. Tell me all that you will,” said
Mère Pauline in accents which custom and virtue alike prevented
from sounding too markedly resigned.</p>

<p>Nina embarked upon the story of her grief. Morris was
the prodigal son—wild, undisciplined, ungrateful, straying
in far foreign lands and leaving an adoring—and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
youthful—parent to deplore his want of affection and of
consideration in the solitude of a country retreat. Only
Mrs. Severing’s Creator shared with her the knowledge of
what such a desertion meant to the heart of a mother.</p>

<p>“<i>Il faut prier.</i>”</p>

<p>Pray! Did not Nina spend the long, lonely watches of the
night in prayers and supplications for the erring one? Was
not this very Retreat to be the occasion of further petitions
on his behalf? Mère Pauline would join with her in storming
Heaven for this object?</p>

<p>“But certainly.” Mère Pauline’s tone was gravely compassionate.
She spoke of trust, patience, and sacrifices to
be offered, and the little homily was accompanied by a pressure
of the hand and softened glance that caused Nina inwardly
to retract, or at least modify as far as she herself
was concerned, the accusation of medievalism.</p>

<p>“After all,” she told herself, retiring in some satisfaction
from the interview, “she is beginning to understand that one
came here from a <i>motive</i>. It’s probably a relief to listen to
something, <i>real</i>, after the endless chatter of that terrible
Mulholland woman.” A heavy step hastening up the stairs
behind her caused Mrs. Severing to glance round with an
apprehension that proved to be only too well founded.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Severing! Mrs. Severing! Just wait one minute.
The stairs try me a little, you know, but I was determined
to catch up with you,” panted Mrs. Mulholland. “I just
want to say one word.”</p>

<p>Nina paused reluctantly, one foot upon the step above that
on which she was standing, and one hand determinedly
grasping the banisters. Mrs. Mulholland stood just below,
heaving from her exertions, and evidently only pausing for
sufficient breath to continue the ascent.</p>

<p>“You escaped me somehow at the chapel door yesterday,
and I’ve been looking for you ever since—just one word I
wanted to say, before we all go into silence. I looked for
you this morning, but I don’t join the ladies at breakfast,
you know, I just have a cup of tea at seven o’clock. A cup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of tea—that’s all I ever take. The fact is, I always go to
the Community Mass at six o’clock. It isn’t the custom for
all the ladies to hear Mass then—they have their own Mass,
at a later hour, as you know. But I always go to the six
o’clock, and stay on for Office afterwards. And then I have
just a cup of tea. Doesn’t give any real trouble to anyone,
you know, not if it’s done regularly.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nina in tones which hitherto had invariably
proved sufficient, from the talented Mrs. Severing, to discourage
any attempt at over-familiarity on the part of her
social inferiors. “Do I understand that you want to speak
to me, Mrs.—er——?”</p>

<p>But even the transparent and insulting manœuvre of appearing
to find Mrs. Mulholland’s name beneath her powers
of recollection, served Mrs. Severing nothing.</p>

<p>“Not here—not here,” said Mrs. Mulholland rebukefully.
“Talking on the stairs is quite against our convent
rules, you know. Mère Pauline doesn’t like it at all. One
or two of the French girls now, you know—I sometimes
find them chattering to one another as they go up or come
down—and I always say, ‘Not here, my dears. Not here,’
I say. ‘Talk as much as ever you like in the parlour or the
dining-room, but not here. Not on the stairs. Mère Pauline
doesn’t like it,’ I say. But of course you’re a stranger
here, and can’t be expected to know all our little regulations.
That’s why I am making an exception of you. But
it doesn’t do if we make a practice of it, or give a bad example.”</p>

<p>Nina was so far from wishing to make a practice of conversing
on the stairs with Mrs. Mulholland, that she was
goaded into saying faintly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps we could come into one of the parlours for a
moment—if you wish to speak to me. I don’t want to
break any rules, and if it would annoy Mère Pauline to find
anybody talking on the stairs——”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Mrs. Severing, that’s right. Why, you’re
quite an example to our younger generation!” was the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
comment selected by Mrs. Mulholland to express
her admiration for this docility. “But you’re all right
under my wing, you know—Mère Pauline wouldn’t say a
word if she found you with me. Now come along into the
parlour. I think there’s one vacant.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland, hurrying downstairs again, consulted
her watch.</p>

<p>“Let me see—Office won’t be over for another twenty
minutes—we’re safe till then. Mère Pauline is pretty sure
to be called to the parlour after that, you know—poor thing,
she sometimes hasn’t a minute to call her own all day, and I
happen to know she’s very tired just now—very tired indeed.
Of course, she never spares herself, and one isn’t
supposed to say anything much about it, but I’m a little bit
in the know, as they say, and she’s very tired just at present,
is Mère Pauline. I wish we could spare her more—but
there it is! The life of a religious is a hard one, and this is
a strict order, Mrs. Severing, as you may have found out.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very strict!” cried Mrs. Mulholland breezily, apparently
supposing that Nina’s frozen ejaculation intimated
a desire for further information. “A lot of people in the
world rather fancy we aren’t so very severe, you know, when
they see Mère Pauline and Mother Juliana and all of them so
frequently in the parlour—but that’s all part of the spirit of
the order. To help those in the world, and bring souls to
God, Mrs. Severing.” Mrs. Mulholland’s bass voice thickened
a little with earnest feeling, and her rather hard black
eyes grew ardent.</p>

<p>“But I mustn’t stay. I haven’t said Office yet. Oh, I
always follow the Office, Mrs. Severing, though I generally
take my breviaries out into the garden, at midday. Now
what was it I wanted to say to you?—oh, about Mother
Juliana it was. Nothing very much, you know, but I
thought I’d better give you the least little hint.” She lowered
her tones mysteriously. “Don’t say anything about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Mother Juliana’s having made her Spiritual Reading at a
different hour yesterday.”</p>

<p>Nina looked wholly bewildered.</p>

<p>“You know I told you she was in the chapel, yesterday,
when the bell was ringing, because there’d been a little alteration,”
pursued Mrs. Mulholland earnestly. “It’s better not
to have any talk about these things. People don’t always
quite understand—outside people, you know—they think
it sounds like irregularity. One doesn’t want to give occasion
for that sort of talk, you know. You don’t mind my
telling you, Mrs. Severing? I know you’re new to our convent
ways. <i>Not</i> a Catholic, are you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not a Catholic,” assented Mrs. Mulholland with unabated
cheerfulness. “Well, well, well. You must let me
say a little prayer for you now and then. Now I’m going
to give you a <i>special</i> intention in my Office.”</p>

<p>She gave the paralyzed Mrs. Severing a couple of friendly
little taps on the shoulder, and hurried away, opening her
large black book of devotions as she went, and Nina, still
rooted to the spot, presently saw her from the window, a
large, unwieldy figure, pounding steadily round and round
the small garden, her black skirts pinned up over a black
stuff petticoat, her spectacled gaze fixed upon her manual,
and her lips moving rapidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are!” said Frances, entering the parlour to
find Mrs. Severing fixedly contemplating this spectacle from
the window.</p>

<p>“I was brought here by the Mulholland woman,” said
Nina bitterly. “There seems to be no escaping her. Does
she run the whole convent, may I ask?”</p>

<p>Frances wisely declined to become controversial on the
point. “I think she means to be very kind to us.”</p>

<p>“I must say, I can’t help being very much amused,” said
Nina in infuriated accents, “at the absurd tone of patronage
she adopts towards me. It really makes me laugh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Laughter was not the predominant emotion discernible in
Mrs. Severing’s voice, but Frances was in a state of spiritual
exaltation that rendered her completely oblivious of outward
impressions.</p>

<p>In all the absolute novelty of her surroundings the singleness
of mind which was characteristic of Frances led her to
seek and find that penetration into detail, that individual
discipline, which she had instinctively asked from the Catholic
Church. The convent world, where religion, and the
outward and inward practice of religion, were the only admitted
goals, brought to her mind that singular sense of completeness
which is only achieved in an atmosphere where the
scale of relative values held by our surroundings is identical
to that which we have long borne in our own inner consciousness.
She wrote long and happy letters to Rosamund.</p>

<p>Far otherwise was it with the unfortunate Nina Severing,
who had already written to Morris, with whom she
maintained a desultory correspondence that alternated between
indignant denunciations and affectionate confidences,
that “it really was too bad of Bertie to persuade me into this
trip, simply because she wouldn’t undertake it herself. The
nuns are very happy and peaceful in their narrow little
world, but it is a narrow and <i>borné</i> outlook, and naturally
a woman of my temperament, who has seen a great deal of
life, is altogether out of her element here.”</p>

<p>Nina generally wrote with greater frankness to her son
than to anyone else. The mental affinity between them was
a strong one, and each was more agreeably aware of it when
away from the other’s immediate society.</p>

<p>This aspect of her relations between herself and her
prodigal, however, was not presented by Nina to Mère
Pauline.</p>

<p>Morris served, as it were, as the <i>point d’appui</i> on which
Mère Pauline’s interest in Mrs. Severing’s spiritual perambulations
rested. It was painfully evident that in the eyes
of the whole community the event of the Retreat was to be
Miss Grantham’s reception into the Church—Mrs. Severing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
was merely an accessory, and one of considerably less
importance, moreover, than even that unknown quantity, the
family of the young convert who had, it was understood,
given so generous a consent to her admission into the fold.</p>

<p>It grew hourly more imperatively evident to Nina that in
Morris, and Morris alone, lay her sole claim to distinction.</p>

<p>“Ah, la pauvre! Elle a un fils qui la fait bien souffrir.
Il faut prier, n’est-ce-pas?”</p>

<p>Such murmurs, from one to another of the community,
might add faint lustre to Mrs. Severing’s name.</p>

<p>“Very interesting your little friend is, very interesting,”
said Mrs. Mulholland to the reluctant Nina on the evening
when the Retreat was about to begin. “We shall none of
us forget her in our prayers, I’m sure—but I shall remember
you too, Mrs. Severing. You have your troubles, I
know—who hasn’t—but I shan’t forget yours during this
holy time—no, indeed. I declare there’s the bell—we
must go to the chapel. Well, well, pray for me and I’ll pray
for you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland adjusted her veil, stuffed a monstrous
pile of small books and devotional-looking little black notebooks
under her arm, grasped her long string of black
rosary-beads, and hastily joined the stream of devout and
thronging ladies now making towards the open door of the
chapel.</p>

<p>It was on the day following that Morris Severing violently
disconcerted his parent and rejoiced the hearts of those who
had been devoutly praying for his return into the paths of
filial devotion, by suddenly arriving in a small motor at the
convent door and charming the old lay-sister who opened it
by his eager and affectionate announcement that he had come
in order to surprise his mother.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHETHER or no Morris was fully aware of the
complete success which crowned this endeavour
might remain open to question. He had recently,
while in Paris, made an Italian friend who, a victim to
home-sickness, had spoken much and eloquently of “<i>la
famiglia</i>” in distant Rome. The impressionable Morris,
rapidly becoming a dozen times more home-sick, if possible,
than his friend, was soon finding it imperative that he should
return to Pensevern, and his widowed mother. The reception,
on the very morning of his departure, of Nina’s letter
announcing her sudden descent upon the convent, had merely
served to increase her son’s impetuous ardour for a meeting.</p>

<p>“I thought of you in uncongenial surroundings, as you
wrote that you were, and probably lonely, and I felt I had
to come,” said Morris, with the direct and manly air of
simplicity that he always regarded as one of his achievements.</p>

<p>“And how many times during the last year have I written
and told you that I was lonely, and implored you to come
home, and you have turned a deaf ear, Morris?” asked
Nina, with stern sadness.</p>

<p>His face hardened—intentionally.</p>

<p>“I have made a mistake, evidently. I thought that after
all these months—but I might have known——” He
broke off with a shrug, which he felt to be a distinct improvement
on that of the Italian friend, who happened to be small
and weedy.</p>

<p>“Might have known what? Don’t be so affected and
ridiculous, Morris, giving mysterious hints that mean nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“I might have known,” said Morris slowly and sadly,
“that you would hardly want to be interrupted in the midst
of a new—enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>His deliberate gaze round the convent parlour gave great
point to the description.</p>

<p>Nina, too much vexed at the moment to think of any
repartee to this shaft, and considerably wrought upon by
conflicting emotions, saw nothing for it but to burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“Morris, darling!” she sobbed. “I can’t bear to welcome
you like this. You know I’m glad to see you, my
precious, precious boy. Haven’t I been longing and praying
for your return day and night?—but why couldn’t you let
me know? What is to become of you if you are always to
act on impulse like this, never considering anyone or anything
but yourself?”</p>

<p>The advantage now distinctly lay with Nina, who thus
skilfully shifted the responsibility for her obvious discomposure
into anxiety for her son’s moral welfare.</p>

<p>She rapidly blinked away the drops on her long eyelashes
and regained her self-command, as a glance at Morris’s
lowering face informed her that the shot had told.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, as you <i>have</i> come, there’s nothing for it
but to see what is convenient to these poor nuns. I don’t
suppose for a moment they can take you in—it’s probably
against all rules: and I don’t know what you would do here.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, no!” ejaculated Morris. “I thought
you’d like me to run you back in the little car, mother. You
haven’t seen her yet—she’s a beauty.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I ought to leave Frances, but”—Nina
pressed her hand to her brow for a moment—“if you
want me to come home, darling, I would leave it all in a
moment, though as a matter of fact the Retreat is hardly
begun.”</p>

<p>“The Retreat!” ejaculated her son in tones of contempt.
“No wonder you were so bored, mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” coldly said Nina, considerably exasperated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
by these continual references to the plaints which now
served merely to discount any lustre of sacrifice which might
have surrounded her departure from the convent. “You
see the Retreat had not begun when I wrote, and naturally
the sort of society here is not likely to prove particularly
congenial to me. But I have to think about you now, and
what is best.”</p>

<p>Morris contrived to insert a sound of amused incredulity
into the low whistle with which he received this announcement
of parental solicitude. Nina, with an air of being too
deeply absorbed in her considerations to spare attention elsewhere,
gazed thoughtfully and with compressed lips at the
small, empty fireplace in front of her, and Morris strolled to
the window with a markedly <i>insouciant</i> demeanour.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere of mental unrest Mère Pauline entered
rapidly and noiselessly, as was her wont.</p>

<p>“Ah, madame!” she cried in tones of congratulation that
verged upon the emotional, “quelle joie—what an answer
to our poor prayers!”</p>

<p>Nina almost mechanically returned the pressure of Mère
Pauline’s hand, and murmured in accents that confusion of
mind rendered almost shamefaced:</p>

<p>“My son, Mère Pauline. Let me present him.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the nun gravely, and inclined her head in
chastened recognition of the prodigal. “<i>Votre maman a
beaucoup souffert</i>,” was the slightly unconventional greeting
which she bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Nina, avoiding glancing at her son, exclaimed with feverish
presence of mind: “One cannot talk <i>à trois</i> very well,
can one? My plans are rather altered by this sudden arrival—you
must let me discuss them with you.”</p>

<p>“But certainly. Would Monsieur care to inspect the
garden?”</p>

<p>“May I see to my car? She’s just outside,” said Morris,
with the boyish smile that added an extraordinary charm
to his good looks and direct blue gaze.</p>

<p>“Yes, by all means,” said Mère Pauline, an answering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
smile almost involuntarily modifying the compassionate
severity of her expression.</p>

<p>Morris made his exit.</p>

<p>The agitated Nina immediately burst into tears again,
partly from a distinct feeling of relief, which unnerved her,
and partly from a desire to gain time.</p>

<p>Mère Pauline said, “Ah! je comprends,” nodded her head
slowly once or twice, and considerately turned her back
upon the weeping Nina.</p>

<p>The extent of this comprehension of Mère Pauline’s soon
became almost overwhelmingly apparent to Mrs. Severing.
The nun held her hand gently and discoursed in rapid and
feeling accents on the <i>changement de cœur</i> which had evidently
been operated on the returned wanderer, and of the
difficult but salutary way of penance and atonement upon
which he would now embark. Her references to St. Augustine
and St. Monica were plentiful.</p>

<p>Nina, bewildered, but soothed, responded in suitably
broken accents, and led the conversation round to the point
of her own immediate departure.</p>

<p>To this Mère Pauline at once acceded. The duties of a
mother came before other things, however good in themselves,
and no doubt for monsieur the quiet of the country—— Mère
Pauline left it to be inferred that a career
of debauchery such as that of Nina’s son, was best expiated
in as remote a corner of the earth as possible.</p>

<p>“I will myself explain to Father Anselm the situation,”
said Mère Pauline gravely, and added an inquiry as to any
possible desire for an interview with the good Prior on the
part of Nina or her son. She did not, however, make the
suggestion in any hopeful accents, and appeared in no way
surprised when it was gracefully declined on the grounds
that the Prior’s time must be much occupied with the Retreat.</p>

<p>“Then I will leave you, madame, to make your preparations
of departure. Shall you require a cab?”</p>

<p>“My son wishes to take me back part of the way by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
motor—it is not such a long journey then,” said Nina.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah! les autos—les autos!</i>” said Mère Pauline, gravely
shaking her head as she went from the parlour.</p>

<p>Morris’s recently acquired two-seater was evidently, in
the eyes of Mère Pauline, responsible for much.</p>

<p>“Did Frances mind your going, mother?” inquired Morris
an hour later, as he drove his mother rapidly away from
the convent.</p>

<p>An almost imperceptible start from the slight veiled figure
beside him confirmed his shrewd suspicion that his mother,
thankfully hastening away from her cloistered solitude, had
forgotten any formality of farewell.</p>

<p>But it was never Mrs. Severing’s way to place herself
at a disadvantage in the eyes of others, and she replied with
great presence of mind:</p>

<p>“I couldn’t make up my mind to disturb her, Morris. I
know how <i>one</i> jarring note vibrates in that kind of atmosphere.”
An expressive turn of Nina’s head left small
room for doubt as to the striker of the jarring note in her
own case, and Morris immediately fixed his eyes upon
space.</p>

<p>“Look what you’re doing, darling—you’re not driving
<i>at all</i> well,” said Nina suavely, as the little car swerved
across the road.</p>

<p>But although victory might lie with Nina on this occasion,
she remained a victim to some mental uneasiness.</p>

<p>Thankfully regaining the luxurious shelter of her own
house, with blazing fires and carpeted spaces in consoling
contrast to the scenes of her late experiment, Mrs. Severing
yet lay back in her capacious armchair that evening, and
murmured disconsolately:</p>

<p>“I suppose Bertie will understand that in all the circumstances
I couldn’t very well stay on with Frances at the
convent. Besides, she’s perfectly happy and absorbed in
it all, and it’s ridiculous to suppose they can’t take care of
her there. I spoke about her myself to Mère Pauline.”</p>

<p>“They’ll make a nun of her, I suppose,” remarked Morris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Well,” said Nina thoughtfully, “it’s a beautiful, sheltered,
peaceful life—no trials, no temptations, no responsibilities.
I’ve often wondered——” She broke off with a
little sigh.</p>

<p>Morris poked the fire briskly, and carefully abstained
from any inquiry into the subject of his mother’s wonder.</p>

<p>“If things had been otherwise,” Nina pursued with determination,
“perhaps I might have sought that quiet, contemplative
way myself. I have a great deal of the cloister
element in me.”</p>

<p>Morris, not in the least amused, but distinctly irritated,
by his parent’s pretensions to a temperament which he did
not believe her to possess, assumed the appearance of one refraining
from all but irrepressible mirth.</p>

<p>Nina compressed her lips, skilfully became several shades
paler, and bade her son good-night in the low, self-controlled
tones of one wounded to the quick.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Severing’s considerable dramatic abilities
were again called into play by the necessity of explaining
to Bertha Tregaskis her desertion of Frances.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d want news of your child, dearest,” she
began fondly, “so I felt I had to come over and tell you all
about everything at once.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis did not appear to be in the least impressed
by the smoothness of this address.</p>

<p>“What I <i>don’t</i> understand, darling,” she returned with
great directness, “is why <i>you</i> are back here and Francie
alone at this convent place. You distinctly said that you
were staying for the whole week and making the Retreat too—otherwise,
as you know, I should have sent Miss Blandflower
with her.”</p>

<p>“Bertie dear,” said her friend with great earnestness, “let
me speak quite frankly and openly to you—of course I
know I may. Don’t you think it’s a pity you don’t <i>trust</i> your
girls rather more? Take Francie now—she’s perfectly
well looked after where she is, and perfectly discreet and
sensible. Why insist on sending someone to watch every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
movement and report on it? Oh, I know you don’t mean it
for watching—or anything of that sort—but that’s probably
what it looks like to the child, and it galls her. I’ve
felt it every moment of the time that I’ve been with her.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me, Nina...?”</p>

<p>“Trust begets trust,” cried Nina, in impassioned tones
that affected to ignore her friend’s interruption. “I’ve
found it so with my own Morris. There’s always been perfect
sympathy between us, and he’s never had a thought or
wish that I haven’t shared. I know Morris as I do myself, I
may say—simply because I’ve always trusted—blindly, implicitly,
if you will, but——”</p>

<p>The trenchant accents of Mrs. Tregaskis, in tones very
much deeper and louder than any at Nina’s command, broke
definitely into this eloquent monologue.</p>

<p>“Now look here, my dear. You know that I’m nothing if
not direct—sledge-hammer, if you like. I can’t stand
shilly-shally.” She planted both hands on her hips, in her
favourite attitude of determination.</p>

<p>“Out with it, Nina. Did you ever mean to make that
Retreat affair at all?”</p>

<p>“Bertie! I don’t know what you mean by speaking to
me in that magisterial tone. I am in the habit of meaning
what I say. I don’t suppose any woman on this earth is
more <i>childishly</i> open and sincere than I am, as you very well
know. Of course I meant to make the Retreat—it has been
a most bitter blow to me that I was unable to finish it—but
my boy’s need comes before anything.”</p>

<p>“His need of what?”</p>

<p>“Of me,” said Nina majestically.</p>

<p>“How can his need of you have sprung up like a mushroom
in the night?” demanded her friend in highly unbelieving
accents. “A week ago you were miserable because he
was wasting time and money in Paris amongst all that
wretched musical crowd”—Nina felt it due to her art to
draw herself up tensely at the description—“and now you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
expect me to believe that he can’t wait quietly at Pensevern
for four days till you come home.”</p>

<p>“If Morris has suddenly realized that he has only one true
friend in all the world—his mother—and turned to her
again—how could she fail him?” pathetically inquired Mrs.
Severing, with a distinct recollection of Mère Pauline’s
flights of fancy.</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear, if Morris has got himself into some
silly scrape and come to you to be helped out, it’s another
thing,” said Bertha unconvincedly. “I’m only too glad, for
your sake, if he has turned to you at last. I know what a
grief and mortification it’s always been to you that you
hadn’t his confidence more—foolish boy!”</p>

<p>“Foolish indeed!” sighed Nina. “But the young like to
fancy that the elder generation does not understand—little
knowing that one has been through all, all, everything, that
can come within their ken a hundred times over. And so
my poor Morris has preferred to bestow his confidence elsewhere—and
oh! how he will regret it some day.”</p>

<p>“As to that,” said Bertha negligently, “it’s really only a
little natural kicking against the pricks of parental authority,
you know. Morris used to talk to <i>me</i> freely enough—we
had some huge pow-wows together over that silly affair
about Rosamund. Boys have a knack of confiding in me.
I always say that I have more young men in my train than
any girl I know!”</p>

<p>“Not more than Hazel,” cried Nina delicately. “I hear
that everyone absolutely raves about her, and she’s looking
too lovely for words. Do tell me, dearest, how, <i>how</i> is the
adorable grandson?”</p>

<p>If Mrs. Severing sought to repay her friend for various
previous thrusts by thus alluding to the latest scion of the
house of Marleswood, whose grandparents had not yet been
privileged to behold him, disappointment was in store for
her. Bertha did indeed reply briefly enough, “Oh, the infant
flourishes magnificently, I believe,” but she added immediately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
in tones that strove to be casual and not triumphant:</p>

<p>“Hazel is bringing him down to us next month. Her
husband has to go to Holland about some property or other,
and she’s coming to us while he’s away.”</p>

<p>“Dearest, <i>how</i> glad I am!”</p>

<p>“It will be a great joy to my old man,” said Bertha
rather wistfully. “The other two girls don’t fill Hazel’s
place in any way. Of course, they’re not one’s own, either,
but I do sometimes wish they had a little more of Hazel’s
sunshine. She <i>was</i> like a ray of sunshine in the house—it
describes her exactly, somehow. Never out of spirits, and
never had a day’s illness in her life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how I envy her!” sighed Nina.</p>

<p>Bertie disregarded this gentle attempt to conduct the conversation
into channels more interesting to Mrs. Severing.</p>

<p>“The house hasn’t been the same place without her
laughter and fun. Poor old Minnie is always more or
less in the doleful dumps, and the two girls can’t see a joke
to save their lives—never could. Frances will be worse
than ever now, I suppose. Tell me about this convent of
hers, Nina, and what she’s doing there? You were hardly
there long enough to find out, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“My dear Bertie,” said Mrs. Severing with dignity. “I
really can’t discuss the matter with you if you will adopt
this extraordinary <i>pose</i> of thinking that I have failed you in
some mysterious manner. I never undertook to do more
than take Frances to the convent and settle her in, and <i>if</i>
circumstances allowed, make the Retreat with her. As it is,
they—they haven’t allowed,” concluded Nina rather lamely.</p>

<p>“So I perceive, and I really can’t blame you, Nina dear.
I never thought you in the least suited to that sort of place—one
can’t fancy you happy in such silent, austere surroundings,”
Bertha said affectionately. “But the question
is, whether I’m to let my little girl stay on alone, or send
Minnie down to join her—or I might even go myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’d be like a fish out of water, darling!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Don’t dream of it. The whole thing is <i>such</i> an atmosphere
of ‘Plain living and high thinking,’” cried Nina.</p>

<p>Bertha laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“The very doctrine I’m always preaching myself! so I
don’t know why you should think it wouldn’t suit me. But,
as a matter of fact, I don’t quite see how I could get away
just now—I’ve a committee meeting to-morrow, and the
Mothers’ Union coming here on Saturday—and I want to
keep an eye on that child of Farmer Trigg’s. I’m pretty
sure the parents are letting it go to chapel with some of
the Dissenters’ children.”</p>

<p>Nina looked profoundly bored.</p>

<p>“Surely that’s a matter for the parson, my dear.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t tell the parson whose children are Church
and whose Chapel,” cried Bertha warmly, “I don’t believe
he’d ever find out. He’s over seventy, and as blind as a
bat. It’s a perfect shame he doesn’t resign—as I said to
the Bishop——”</p>

<p>Nina had heard her friend discourse before upon the
deficiencies of that friend’s spiritual pastor and master and
felt no slightest interest in the subject. So she exclaimed
with an air of sudden inspiration:</p>

<p>“Bertie! Forgive me for interrupting you, darling—it
doesn’t mean that I’m not interested, for I am, and I
<i>entirely</i> think with you—but I’ve just had an idea.
There’s quite a nice woman at the convent, to whom I should
have recommended Frances most particularly, if only I
hadn’t been in such a hurry, with simply no time to think of
anything. But if I sent her one line——”</p>

<p>Nina’s pause implied boundless devotion on the part of
the quite nice woman.</p>

<p>“Is she a Sister?” asked Bertie, not unsuspiciously.</p>

<p>“Dear me, no, nothing of that sort. Just making the Retreat,
like myself,” said Nina vaguely. “A Mrs. Mulholland—rather
a talker, but <i>quite</i> to be depended on, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bertha doubtfully. “It would be very inconvenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
to let Minnie go just now, and she’d hate it, poor
thing. And I suppose the child is all right really—it’s only
that one’s old-fashioned notions don’t like the idea of her
being there under nobody’s charge but her own.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write to-night,” said Nina effusively, “and put her
under Mrs. Mulholland’s charge. I quite meant to do it
when I found myself obliged to rush away, but something
prevented it at the last moment. Don’t dream of worrying
for an instant, dearest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t worry, as you know. I’m a practical woman,
Nina,” said Bertha bluntly. “Just write a line to this friend
of yours, then, will you? and it can go to the post with the
letters at once.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Severing had hardly contemplated so prompt an
action, but she was relieved at shifting the onus of her responsibility
so lightly, and sat down willingly enough to
transfer it on to the substantial shoulders of Mrs. Mulholland.</p>

<p>Two days later she triumphantly confronted Mrs. Tregaskis
with the reply.</p>

<p>“Why four pages?” curtly demanded Bertha, elevating
her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“She gives me many little convent details which would
hardly, of course, interest an outsider, but which mean something
to me,” said Mrs. Severing, with the air of a lady-abbess.</p>

<p>“May I read it?”</p>

<p>“I can read you the bit which refers to Frances.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, is it private? After two days’ acquaintance!
I always say, Nina, that you dash into intimacies quicker
than any woman I’ve ever known.”</p>

<p>“How preposterous you are, Bertie. Of course there’s
nothing private in Mrs. Mulholland’s letter. I merely
thought it might bore you. Please do read it, if you are so
insatiably curious. It always amuses me to see the delightful
way in which you poke and ferret about into everything,
like a beloved bloodhound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Bloodhounds don’t ferret,” remarked Mrs. Tregaskis,
taking Mrs. Mulholland’s voluminous epistle from her
friend’s hand with an air of great annoyance.</p>

<p>The air of annoyance was merged into astonishment, not
unmixed with amusement, as she perused the four large
pages covered with thick, black writing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">The Convent</span>,<br>
<span class="indentright2">“<i>Friday</i>.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Severing</span>,</p>

<p>“You must forgive me not answering your little note at
once, but we only came out of Retreat this morning. I was
sorry to hear of your sudden departure, and also not to have
said good-bye, but perhaps we shall see you down here again
one of these days. Your little friend has been very happy,
and has edified us all during the Retreat. I am sure she
must be very pleasing to our dear Lord. I hear that the
Prior is very much pleased with her indeed, and hopes to
receive her very soon now. What a joy that must be to you!
since I could not help feeling, dear Mrs. Severing, that
you were very much with us <i>in spirit</i>.</p>

<p>“Mère Pauline has told me of the great joy which has
come to you in your dear son’s return, and you must please
accept my very warmest congratulations. There may still
be dark days ahead of you, but <i>while there’s life there’s hope</i>.</p>

<p>“Miss Grantham will no doubt write to you of the Retreat.
It was quite beautiful, and the discourse this morning
which came before the bestowal of the Papal Blessing
was most moving. I feel that we have all derived great
benefit and many graces, and you may be sure that I remembered
my promise to say many a little prayer for you <i>and
yours</i>.</p>

<p>“Mère Pauline sends many kind thoughts, and will not
forget you in her good prayers. And now, with most
earnest wishes for the future, dear Mrs. Severing, I must
close.</p>

“<i>E. de M.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Bertha returned the letter without a word to its owner.</p>

<p>But the goaded Mrs. Severing was not yet free to take
her departure from Porthlew.</p>

<p>She was waylaid in the very hall by Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Wretched child!” thought Nina, who had by this time
educated herself into thinking of Miss Grantham solely as
the destroyer of Morris’s peace of mind. “However, I suppose
she’s miserable by this time, and wants to know if
there’s any chance of patching up a meeting or something
with him.”</p>

<p>With this in mind, Mrs. Severing advanced with an air of
guilelessness, and a sense of diplomacy.</p>

<p>“I’m <i>just</i> off, dear,” she said sweetly to Rosamund.
“Your beloved guardian has really tempted me to stay on
longer than I ought—it <i>is</i> such a joy to spend an hour with
her.”</p>

<p>“I won’t keep you one minute,” said Rosamund, “but I
had to ask you—I do so want to hear....”</p>

<p>Nina’s expressive eyebrows mounted.</p>

<p>“About Frances,” said Rosamund eagerly, quite unaware
that she was disconcerting the diplomatic Mrs. Severing considerably.
The shock of finding her discernment at fault,
almost equally with her annoyance at being once more asked
to render an account of her shifted responsibilities, caused
Mrs. Severing to reply with considerably less than her usual
suavity:</p>

<p>“Frances! What about her? I’ve left her in charge of a
most delightful woman, and she’s perfectly happy. Just
as the young,” said Nina viciously, “always are.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHREWD as Mrs. Tregaskis was, it was not until after
Nina had departed, serene and triumphant, that she
suddenly exclaimed, pondering over the ingenuous
epistle of Mrs. Mulholland:</p>

<p>“It’s all very well, but that woman never answered one
word about looking after Frances. She wrote about everything
else under the sun, but not a single definite assurance
in the whole caboodle. What an unpractical lot these holy
females are! It’s enough to drive a plain common-sense
Cornish body to distraction.”</p>

<p>She laughed in humorous deprecation of her own harassed
tones, and Miss Blandflower remarked sympathetically:</p>

<p>“Fancy that, now. Dear Mrs. Tregaskis, wouldn’t you
like me to join the fray? I could run down there, have a
look at Francesca, and trot back to report progress. Or
bring her home in my pocket.”</p>

<p>Bertha looked at her proposed deputy with rather a doubtful
expression.</p>

<p>“You’d hate it, Minnie, wouldn’t you? The very bosom
of the Scarlet Woman, you know!”</p>

<p>“England expects every man to do his duty,” replied Miss
Blandflower courageously, but she looked infinitely relieved
when Mrs. Tregaskis laughed again, and said tolerantly:</p>

<p>“No, no, Minnie, I don’t think we’ll expose you to contamination.
If anyone goes, I’ll go myself—but we’ll see
what the next letters are like.”</p>

<p>The next letters, however, from the Porthlew point of
view were far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>“This tone of little Frances’ won’t do at all,” declared
Bertha very decidedly, at breakfast. “Quite a new departure!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Talking about being ‘received into the Church at
once,’ and ‘discussing further plans’ when she gets home.
I never heard of such a thing—what are little girls coming
to, pray?”</p>

<p>“What are little girls made of? Sugar and spice and all
that’s nice,” muttered Minnie in the inward voice which she
reserved for her frequent and irrelevant quotations.</p>

<p>“Nice, indeed!” retorted Mrs. Tregaskis crisply, “anything
but, my poor Minnie. This won’t do at all. Miss
Frances must be popped back into her little place again, I’m
afraid. You needn’t scowl at me, Rosamund. Nobody is
going to be at all unkind or brutal, but if this is the effect
that Roman Catholicism is going to have on Frances, why,
the sooner she’s taken away from the convent the better.
In any case I never gave her leave to stay for more than a
few days’ Retreat, and now she writes quite calmly that she
is to be ‘received’ at the end of the week, without so much
as with your leave or by your leave.”</p>

<p>“If she’s made up her mind, Bertha—and I conclude
that she has—you can’t stop her, and you’d better leave her
alone,” growled Frederick.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, dear. She’s not so emancipated as all that,
yet. Besides, we <i>have</i> given a sort of consent, in a way, by
letting her go to this place—though it was against my better
judgment, as you know.”</p>

<p>“Your better judgment, Bertha, is only less to be relied
on than your original impulse.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis invariably treated these speeches of her
lord and master as a recondite form of pleasantry. She
therefore laughed valiantly at the epigrammatic insult, and
merely told Minnie to give her the marmalade.</p>

<p>“Ma-me-laid, as the chicken said,” lugubriously and quite
absent-mindedly remarked Miss Blandflower, neither she
nor anyone else paying the slightest heed to the historic jest,
which she repeated almost every morning of her life.</p>

<p>“Well,” Bertha said at last, “I suppose I must sacrifice
the poor Mothers’ Union and trot after my stray lamb. I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
a very good mind to pay her a surprise visit, and see what
she’s really up to.”</p>

<p>“Frances would never deceive you, Cousin Bertie,” indignantly
said Rosamund.</p>

<p>“I dare say, my dear; but Frances is with people whom I
know very little about, and I can’t tell what nonsense they
may be stuffing into her little head. Anyway, I’m going to
find out.”</p>

<p>“Better send Rosamund,” was the observation of her
Cousin Frederick, uttered in tones which conveyed at one
and the same time the impressions that he was making the
suggestion sarcastically, and that he knew it would be displeasing
to his wife.</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at Mrs. Tregaskis. She had not the
slightest expectation of accompanying her to the convent,
and was not even sure that she wanted to do so.</p>

<p>“Rubbish,” said Mrs. Tregaskis briskly. “No use glowering
at me, Rosamund. You’d be dreadfully in my way,
darling, and in Frances’, too, little though you may believe
it. She’s never quite natural and open when you’re there
to try and tell her what she must say and what she
mustn’t.”</p>

<p>This observation, partly from the substratum of truth
which it contained, always roused in Rosamund a fury of
pain and resentment.</p>

<p>She told herself vehemently that Cousin Bertie never understood
anything, and hated the quick, angry flush that
denoted her feelings plainly to that amused, observant eye.</p>

<p>Her retaliation she knew, with all the impotent anger of
youth at its own inadequacy, to be as awkward and ineffectual
as it was fierce.</p>

<p>“I shall certainly write and tell Francie that you are
coming, Cousin Bertie.”</p>

<p>“Oho! You think she wouldn’t appreciate a surprise
visit, is that it? It doesn’t speak very well for your theory
that Frances would never deceive me, does it?” laughed
Bertha. “Very well, my dear, write to her by all means,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
and say that I’ll be there on Saturday. I can’t possibly get
away to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no,” said Minnie anxiously. “There’s your
dairy class in the morning, and then Nurse Watkins wants
to come and talk to you about that poor woman with the
twins, and isn’t it the third Friday of the month? because
that’s your committee meeting out at Polwerrow, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall have my hands full. You’ll have to take
the mothers on Saturday afternoon, Minnie. I’ll give you
the leaflets to distribute, and they must have tea as usual,
and you or Rosamund might read them a little something
afterwards. I’ll look out something or other that will do.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be dreadfully disappointed at not seeing you,”
sighed Miss Blandflower.</p>

<p>“Tell them how sorry I am to be away. It’s not often
I’ve missed one of the meetings, is it? The fact is, it does
me good to talk to them all and hear all about baby’s croup
and Old Man Granfer’s rheumatism and the rest of it. I
revel in a gude old clackit o’ wummin, as we say down
here.”</p>

<p>“They all adore you,” said the faithful Minnie.</p>

<p>“Rubbish, my dear! It’s only that one has a knack of understanding
them, and then they’ve known me all my life.
Why, I’m still ‘Miss Bertie’ to most of them!”</p>

<p>Bertha laughed, finished her breakfast, and told Minnie to
come and help her get ready for the dairy class.</p>

<p>Helping Mrs. Tregaskis never meant anything more than
the more mechanical jobs that she herself had not time to
undertake, but Minnie followed her obediently, and spent the
intervening time until Saturday toiling blindly and ineffectively
in her wake.</p>

<p>“I’m so dreadfully afraid that I shall forget something
or other,” she sighed, watching Mrs. Tregaskis drive away
from the hall door. “I’ve not got her head for organization,
you know. Ah well! it takes all sorts to make a world,
as they say.”</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Miss Blandflower’s distrust of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
her own capability as a substitute was not unshared by Mrs.
Tregaskis.</p>

<p>“Poor old Minnie! She always does her best,” Bertha
said to her husband as he drove her to the station. “But
I’m afraid there’ll be a big accumulation by the time I get
back. However, it’s all in the day’s work, and the main
point just now is to see what Frances is up to.”</p>

<p>Frederick remained silent, and she added hastily:</p>

<p>“Now, not another word till we get to the station. I’ve
promised myself the luxury of this quiet half-hour to go over
the blanket-club accounts.”</p>

<p>She pulled out of her bag a little red notebook and was
immersed in figures until they reached the station.</p>

<p>Nor did Mrs. Tregaskis’ activities cease when she had
established herself in the corner-seat of a third-class railway-carriage.</p>

<p>There was a woman seated opposite to her whose baby
was fractious and crying, and only howled the louder at
Bertha’s kind, broad smiles and dangled watch-chain. She
gave the mother a few words of advice as to its feeding, and
laughed away her stammered apologies at the baby’s ungracious
reception of the lady’s kindness.</p>

<p>At the first stop a young girl whom Mrs. Tregaskis knew
by sight as the daughter of a distant farmer, got into the
carriage, her head muffled in a shawl, and immediately shut
both windows with a timid, “Excuse me—I have the toothache.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” cried Bertha with jovial decision, and
lowering the window furthest from the girl’s swollen face.
“Sit over there, Nellie, and you won’t feel it. It <i>is</i> Nellie
Jewell, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nellie, I’m very sorry you’ve got toothache, but
we’re—let me see—one, two, three, <i>four</i> people in here
besides yourself! Five, if we count this little man,” she
added, with a laughing nod at the unresponsive baby, “and
I don’t see why he shouldn’t have his share of fresh air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
You wouldn’t want five people to do without God’s lovely
fresh air that’s so good for us all, just because you’ve got
toothache, Nellie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to catch cold in ’un, Mrs. Tregaskis,” muttered
the girl sullenly.</p>

<p>But she left the window open.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Tregaskis asked her if she’d been to the
dentist.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Tregaskis. I’m just on my way back. But
her culdn’t du nothin’ for me while ’tis swollenlike.”</p>

<p>“No, I see that. You silly girl, you ought to have gone
before it got so bad. If only you girls ate fewer sweets,
you wouldn’t have such bad teeth—but at any rate, if you
<i>must</i> give yourself toothache, you ought to be brave and go
to see the dentist before getting to this stage. Now I don’t
suppose you’ve been able to do much towards helping your
mother for the last week, have you, with your mouth in that
state?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of a flounce in Nellie Jewell’s
movements as she rose to get out at the next station.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Nellie. I hope you’ll have had that tooth
right out next time I see you,” said Bertha, with unperturbed
good-humour.</p>

<p>She made a mental note to the effect that she must call
on Nellie Jewell’s mother when she got back and see if
they couldn’t persuade the girl to become an Associate of
the G.F.S. She seemed to be a silly girl, but no doubt
something could be done for her.</p>

<p>For the rest of the journey Mrs. Tregaskis dismissed
parochial concerns from her mind, and allowed herself the
luxury of an uninterrupted hour’s reading of “La vie des
Abeilles.” She enjoyed, quite consciously, the sense that
this was the first time she had had spare time in which to
read it at leisure during the six months she had had the
book in hand.</p>

<p>The journey was a long one, and packets of sandwiches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
were produced on either side of her, but Mrs. Tregaskis
always grudged time given to food, and only at the last
junction put her head out of the window and allowed herself
to drink two cups of very strong tea from the station
refreshment-room.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o’clock before she reached, by means of
the slowest of cabs, the convent door.</p>

<p>She looked at the unimposing building, high and narrow
like the buildings on either side of it, with some contempt.
It was not at all picturesque, like the charming convents
or monasteries of her experience in Italy and Southern
France. Only a modest brass plate on the door and a blue
and white figure cut out of what used to be called “transparencies”
and pasted against the inside of the glass fan-light,
proclaimed the house to be a convent.</p>

<p>Once inside, however, Bertha thought that her surroundings
left small room for doubt. The small, dark parlour
was hung with highly-coloured devotional pictures, a cheap
coloured statuette stood on the mantelpiece and another one
on a bracket over the door.</p>

<p>Contrary to the conventual wont, however, Mrs. Tregaskis
was not kept waiting. Frances came into the room
almost immediately. She did not greet her guardian with
any of the timidity which she often displayed, and which
Mrs. Tregaskis had half expected.</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie, I <i>am</i> so glad you’ve come! It was so
much easier to talk than to write—you know how bad I
am at letters.”</p>

<p>“Your last letter was rather explicit, Francie, my child,”
said Bertha drily. “We’ll have a long talk about it to-morrow,
but just at present I want to know whether these good
nuns are expecting me. I suppose you asked them if I
could have a room?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ve got the one Mrs. Severing had. You see,
the Retreat was over two or three days ago, so most of the
visitors have gone. There are only the usual lady boarders
left now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“The Retreat was over two or three days ago, was it?
I see.”</p>

<p>Frances flushed at her guardian’s tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Bertie, if Rosamund hadn’t said that you
were coming here I meant to have written you a long letter,
and told you why I was staying on, and everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Mrs. Tregaskis, still dryly. “I hope
you did. I feel sure you did. Now show me where my
room is, will you?”</p>

<p>Frances, the look of pleasure on her face altogether
dashed, preceded Mrs. Tregaskis to the room next to her
own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis, as usual, was appreciative and observant,
was charmed at having a window that looked out on
to the garden, and thanked Frances delightedly for the little
vase of flowers arranged upon the tiny dressing-table.
Frances reflected remorsefully that Cousin Bertie never
failed in recognition of any effort, however small, to give
her pleasure. Joined to the thought, however, was the subconscious
conviction that neither did Cousin Bertie ever
fail to mark and remember any infringement, however
trivial, of the wide, easy, and yet inflexible discipline which
she was apt to wield over all her surroundings.</p>

<p>It was perhaps this unacknowledged certainty which
drove Frances, as soon as breakfast was over on the following
morning, to withdraw herself and her guardian, with
unwonted decision, from the voluble overtures of Mrs. Mulholland,
to the comparative privacy of the small garden. It
was only nine o’clock, and they both shivered a little in the
raw morning air.</p>

<p>“Tut! This won’t do,” exclaimed Bertha. “Come
along, Francie—in step, now.”</p>

<p>She began to chant with a sort of martial ardour, keeping
time as she stepped out gallantly:</p>

<p>“I had a good place and I <i>left</i>—<i>left</i>—<i>left</i>; I’m out of
work now and it serves me jolly well <i>right</i>—<i>right</i>—<i>right</i>!
Soon be warm at this rate! Don’t shiver like that, Francie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
Why, bless me! it’s good to be alive on a day like this.”</p>

<p>Frances was guiltily conscious that her shivers were not
altogether due to defective circulation.</p>

<p>She made a great effort, clenching her small fists unseen,
and said valiantly:</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie, you know that I’m staying on here because
I want to be received as a Catholic next week. They
are—quite willing.”</p>

<p>She felt uncomfortably breathless, and her voice caught
in her throat once or twice.</p>

<p>None of Hazel’s valour in opposition would ever be
Frances’.</p>

<p>Bertha’s voice was most reassuringly kind.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, we must talk it over a little bit. Why
so much haste?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t quite know what there is to wait for,”
faltered Frances, conscious of the lack of conviction in her
voice.</p>

<p>That Cousin Bertie was also conscious of it was evident
in the tone of smooth good-humour in which she replied:</p>

<p>“I might perhaps answer that you could wait to be a
little older and wiser and more experienced, or that later on
you may reproach me bitterly for having allowed you to
take a decisive step in a fit of enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” breathed Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” cried Bertha cheerfully. “I can assure
you that people <i>do</i> change their minds, astonishing though
it may seem to you, my darling, and that even ten years
hence you’ll feel quite differently about nearly everything
under the sun. Tell me, don’t you see for yourself that
you’ve changed a good deal since you were a little girl of
fourteen or fifteen, even? Aren’t almost all your opinions,
and values, and ambitions quite different?”</p>

<p>Frances reflected conscientiously and then replied rather
timidly:</p>

<p>“No, Cousin Bertie. I don’t think they are.”</p>

<p>Bertha broke into her ringing laugh, her head flung back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Oh, my dear little girl! You’re even younger than I
thought you were. It’s a shame to laugh at you when
you’re so much in earnest—but you’ll laugh at yourself in
a very little while. Oh, Francie, Francie!”</p>

<p>She laughed again, irrepressibly.</p>

<p>At last she became serious.</p>

<p>“Now, Frances, bar all joking. Tell me exactly why you
want to join the Catholic Church.”</p>

<p>Frances noted gratefully that her guardian, speaking to
her of the Catholic Church, did not use the prefix “Roman.”</p>

<p>She gave a stammering, halting summary of reasons,
which sounded curiously unconvincing even to her own
ears, for wishing to become a Catholic as soon as possible.
Even the attentive silence, punctuated by quiet movements
of the head, in which Bertha listened to her, seemed to add
to the sense of pitiful inadequacy overwhelming her.</p>

<p>She knew that her uneloquent, shakily-spoken sentences
gave no hint of the passionate convictions and determinations
seething within her.</p>

<p>“Will you talk to Father Anselm—the Prior, you know—or
to Mère Pauline?” she ended desperately.</p>

<p>“Certainly I will,” said Bertha promptly. “I had already
meant to do so, my child, since these people have
taken a very big responsibility on themselves in persuading
you to leave your own Church before you’re even old
enough to know what you’re doing. They’ve got to render
a very strict account of it to me, too.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie, there’s one thing,” said Frances, flushing
scarlet. “By rights, the Catholic Church <i>ought</i> to be
my own Church, because my mother was one, and if—if
the rules and things had been as strict then as they are now,
Rosamund and I would have <i>had</i> to be baptized Catholics.”</p>

<p>Bertha responded instantly:</p>

<p>“That’s quite true, Francie, and it’s because of that, and
because we know that your dear mother belonged to that
Faith, that Cousin Frederick and I are allowing you so
much latitude. You see, darling, if <i>Hazel</i> had taken this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
turn, we should have forbidden it outright until she was at
least twenty-one—but it’s not quite the same thing where
you’re concerned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Bertie, how kind and understanding you
are!”</p>

<p>“Ah, the dull old people with Experience behind them do
sometimes understand, don’t they?” asked Bertha playfully.
“Well, now, what about a chat with the Reverend Mother
Superior and all these good people? Can I see any of
them?”</p>

<p>“I expect so,” said Frances, glad to think that her cause
should be transferred to better hands than her own.</p>

<p>They went indoors again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“LET me speak,” earnestly said Mrs. Mulholland.
Unnecessarily.</p>

<p>No one could have stopped her.</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis did not attempt to, but listened with a
broad, if rather fixed smile, and an impatient foot tapping
the floor with sharp, irregular beats.</p>

<p>Regardless of the fact that it was Sunday evening, and
that Mrs. Mulholland’s hands were locked, severely unoccupied,
in her ample lap, Bertha was knitting vigorously.</p>

<p>She had had a day of interviews, in which it seemed to
her that the Prior of Twickenham’s bland assumption of a
knowledge of the world which he obviously did not possess
was only less provoking than Mère Pauline’s austere conviction
that <i>le bon Dieu</i> alone was conducting the <i>affaire
Frances</i> and was not, and never had been, in receipt of
extraneous aid from even the most chosen of His instruments.</p>

<p>Smilingly refusing to take these or similar assertions in
any way for granted, Bertha had nevertheless made small
headway against the unescapable fact that Frances, and
that potent agent, Frances’ conscience, were arrayed against
her.</p>

<p>Vexed in spirit, but still indomitable, she had fallen a
victim, at the end of the day, to the assiduous pursuit of the
zealous Mrs. Mulholland.</p>

<p>“<i>La mère des dames pensionnaires</i>,” was her emotional
introduction of herself, spoken with an atrocious accent.</p>

<p>“That’s what our lay-sisters here all call me, you know.
The mother of the lady boarders. That’s what it means:
the mother of the lady boarders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>Bertha smiled.</p>

<p>“<i>La mère des dames pensionnaires</i>,” she repeated, less because
she was impressed by the title than in order that her
French pronunciation should make it evident how extremely
unnecessary Mrs. Mulholland’s translation had been.</p>

<p>“That’s it, my dear—excuse me calling you so—that’s
it. I see you understand French as well as I do myself.
I always say that’s one of the advantages of living with a
French community, as I do—one gets to know the language
as though it was one’s own. Quite a French order,
ours is, you know—founded by a Frenchwoman, Mam’selle
Simone Vergy de Lange, in Paris. Ah, poor Paris! No
convents there now, you know, Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>“No, alas! Even when I was last there, about ten years
ago, it——”</p>

<p>“Terribly sad, terribly sad,” interrupted Mrs. Mulholland;
“but it’ll bring a judgment on the country. Mark
my words, it’ll bring a judgment. All those flourishing
Orders scattered and sent into exile—they can’t feel it
anything but exile, you know—there they are, all over the
place.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis cleared her throat resolutely.</p>

<p>“A good many of them have found hospitality here in
England,” she began firmly.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, yes, yes. A blessing in disguise for this poor
Protestant country—that’s what I always feel. Who
knows what it may lead to? I dare say it’s largely for England’s
sake that all this terrible persecution has been allowed,
and then in return for the charity and hospitality
they’ve received, these good monks and nuns will help to
spread the Faith.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a Roman Catholic,” said Mrs. Tregaskis.</p>

<p>She might have omitted the “Roman” but for her certainty
of Mrs. Mulholland’s complete invulnerability.</p>

<p>In effect, Mrs. Mulholland merely retorted in unabashed
assent:</p>

<p>“Quite so, quite so. You’ll excuse me saying that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
already aware of that, Mrs. Tregaskis, quite aware of it.
But I always say just what I think—no respecter of persons,
so to speak. Say what you think and think what you
say is my motto—always has been.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis felt rather as though she were listening to
a caricature of herself.</p>

<p>“Now I dare say you have a prejudice against religious
orders—many people have, I know—quite good people,
mind you, who only need a little enlightenment.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I can assure——”</p>

<p>“Never mind, never mind!” cried Mrs. Mulholland with
breezy inattention. “I know all about it, and you must
remember that I’m a woman of the world, Mrs. Tregaskis,
though I do live in a convent, and can see your point of view
as well as ours. It’s all quite natural, and I can assure you
that a great many people have felt just as you do.
Especially about foreign Orders—French and the like, you
know. Not got quite our ideas about fresh air, for instance,
or a daily bath—<i>that</i> sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Bertha drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“I dare say not,” she said in a louder voice than usual,
“but I’ve had plenty of truck with convents and the like
in my time, you know—in Italy, and so on. Naturally,
one has no insular prejudices of an early Victorian kind,
after knocking about the world as I’ve done.”</p>

<p>She laughed heartily, but briefly, being well aware that
any opening would be seized upon by Mrs. Mulholland to
make her own voice heard once more.</p>

<p>“Now, you must forgive me, but I must go and hunt up
my chick-a-biddy. I don’t know where the child’s got to
since supper.”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear Mrs. Tregaskis, listen to me, and let that
child alone. Let her alone, I say,” commanded Mrs. Mulholland,
in accents of authority such as had never been
addressed to the astonished Bertha since her schooldays.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis drew herself up to the full of her very
considerable height, looked Mrs. Mulholland up and down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
with an expression of astounded contempt, and rose without
a word from her seat. Upon which Mrs. Mulholland,
with surprising and most unexpected agility, rose also, and
planted her enormous bulk against the closed door of the
small parlour.</p>

<p>“Now, listen to me,” was her superfluous injunction as
she and Mrs. Tregaskis stood facing one another, at a distance
of about two yards apart. “You’ll think me very
strange, I dare say”—Bertha’s face showed the absolute
correctness of this supposition—“very strange, perhaps.
But what people think doesn’t matter to me, Mrs. Tregaskis.
We’ve got to trample human respect underfoot in
a matter like this. I shouldn’t feel that I was doing my
duty if I didn’t speak out. You may say it’s no business of
mine, but Miss Grantham has talked to me—very fully,
I may say, on the whole—and so’s Mère Pauline. That
child wishes to be received into the Church, Mrs. Tregaskis.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason for discussing the subject with you,”
said Bertha, thoroughly incensed, and ignoring the very
tangible reason in front of her. “Kindly let me pass out of
that door.”</p>

<p>But the person who is hampered by the instincts of good
breeding is at a disadvantage when dealing with an antagonist
prepared serenely to ignore even the more elementary
canons of behaviour. It did not occur to Bertha, resolute
as she was, to launch herself bodily upon the sturdy old
woman who stood in front of the door and force a way past
her. Still less did it occur to her that Mrs. Mulholland
would continue to maintain her spread-eagle attitude the
more defiantly for this very forbearance.</p>

<p>But no trifling considerations for the ethics of good taste
were ever destined to stand in Mrs. Mulholland’s way.</p>

<p>Her massive bulk against the door, her large hands
gesticulating emphatically, she freed her mind in hoarse,
vehement accents that completely overpowered the spasmodic
attempts of her audience to interrupt her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“I know very well that Mère Pauline’s been talking to
you, and that good holy Prior. But there it is, people in the
world look upon priests and nuns as unpractical—they
won’t listen. But I tell you, Mrs. Tregaskis, speaking as
one woman who’s seen life to another, that if ever there was
a case of absolute genuine conversion, it’s that child—that
ward of yours, or whatever she is. If you withhold her
from the true Light, out of worldly consideration or any
other motive, you’ll be doing a most serious wrong, Mrs.
Tregaskis—a most serious wrong. I’m all for obedience
and discipline, as a rule. ‘If you don’t obey,’ I say, ‘you’ll
never know how to command,’ is what I say. But if little
Miss Grantham comes to me for advice, I shall tell her just
what I think.”</p>

<p>“Kindly let me——”</p>

<p>“<i>Just</i> what I think. She must go straight ahead and
follow her conscience in spite——”</p>

<p>The door-handle turned from outside.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” almost shouted Mrs. Mulholland in
truculent accents.</p>

<p>“It is I. Mère Pauline.”</p>

<p>The small, trenchant voice fell like a douche of cold
water on the agitation within. Mrs. Mulholland, in some
strange way, seemed to Bertha to crumple up under the
severely inquiring gaze of the little French Superior.</p>

<p>“What is all this?”</p>

<p>“A most unjustifiable piece of interference on the part of
this person,” said Mrs. Tregaskis, in no uncertain accents.
“She appears to think herself called upon to give me advice
about the child I’ve brought up.”</p>

<p>The corners of Mère Pauline’s little mouth closed more
firmly, and she turned an inquiring gaze through her spectacles
on to Mrs. Mulholland, whose face was now suffused.
She had the angry, confused aspect of a child detected in
naughtiness.</p>

<p>“Well, well, ma Mère, I may have exceeded my rights
a little in what I said. I know very well I’m apt to get excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
when it’s a question of gaining a soul for God——”</p>

<p>“I think you ’ave exceeded them very considerably,” said
Mère Pauline with perfect candour. “It was not your
business.”</p>

<p>The mighty bulk of Mrs. Mulholland seemed to droop
under the icy accents of the little Superior.</p>

<p>She gulped loudly two or three times, and then said very
humbly, and with obvious effort, to Mrs. Tregaskis:</p>

<p>“Then I hope you’ll excuse me. I—I hope you’ll forgive
me, Mrs. Tregaskis. I’m afraid my interference may
have done more harm than good.”</p>

<p>“Say no more about it,” said Bertha bluntly. “I quite
understand.”</p>

<p>She was astounded at the sudden change operated in the
redoubtable Mrs. Mulholland, and when the old woman had
gone heavily and dejectedly from the room she told Mère
Pauline so frankly.</p>

<p>“Oui, oui,” said the imperturbable Superior dispassionately.
“Elle a beaucoup de vertu, beaucoup d’humilité, la
pauvre. One word is enough. She is very good, in spite
of that tongue.”</p>

<p>“Now, is that the effect of her religion—the humility, I
mean, not the tongue?”</p>

<p>“But yes, madame, naturally. What else should make
her own herself in the wrong, like a child that is scolded?
The Catholic religion teaches nothing if not the practice of
humility in everyday life.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” cried Bertha, half-laughing, “if I
thought it would have that effect upon Frances, she should
do as she liked to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was perhaps the strategical opening for which she had
subconsciously been waiting in order to effect a graceful
retreat from a position of resistance rapidly growing untenable.</p>

<p>At all events Frances found that her guardian offered no
further definite opposition to her wishes.</p>

<p>“Mind you, my child, I don’t approve of what you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
doing,” Bertha told her gravely, “but neither your Cousin
Frederick nor I wish to forbid it definitely. As you know,
I’m not very much bound by any creed myself, so perhaps I
don’t attach as much importance to your leaving the Church
of England as other people may. So long as we all keep as
straight as we can and play the game it doesn’t seem to
me to matter very much what we call ourselves. So I’m
going to leave you free to make your own choice, my little
Francie.”</p>

<p>“I <i>wish</i> you didn’t mind—I <i>wish</i> I hadn’t got to make
you unhappy,” said Frances in tears.</p>

<p>Bertha kissed her.</p>

<p>“My poor little girl, I wish I’d never let these people get
hold of you and your poor little conscience.”</p>

<p>Frances immediately drew herself away, colouring.</p>

<p>“What! Mustn’t I even criticize them?” said Bertha,
half sadly, half playfully. “Fathers and mothers get left
alone in the old nest very quickly, when the young birds first
find their wings, Francie. You’ll find that out one day.”</p>

<p>Frances told herself, with a quick pang of compassion,
that Cousin Bertie was thinking as much of Hazel as of
her.</p>

<p>“It won’t make any difference,” she faltered anxiously,
hardly knowing what she said. “At least——”</p>

<p>“Ah! At least——” said Bertha, laughing a little.
“Well, my Francie, you’re joining the Church into which
your mother was born, and I hope with all my heart that
you’ll find all you expect there. And your old heretic
guardian will be in a corner in the chapel when you’re
received, praying for whatever is best for you.”</p>

<p>The ceremony of Frances’ reception into the Catholic
Church took place quietly in the convent chapel a day or two
later.</p>

<p>Only Bertha Tregaskis and one or two members of the
Community were present, but before the brief ceremony
was over Mrs. Mulholland creaked in, with elaborate gestures
of silence, sank upon her knees in the bench beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Bertha, and turned upon her a smile in which triumph and
compassion were strangely blended.</p>

<p>“The deed is done,” wrote Bertha that evening, in a
hasty scrawl addressed to Miss Blandflower. “The child
seems happy, and I hope she’ll settle down after this.
Everyone goes through some sort of youthful crisis, and I
have a great belief in getting it over early. We shall be
back on Friday, after a night spent with Hazel in London.
One hint, Minnie, before I finish this scribble—treat
Frances just as though nothing had happened, won’t you?
The excitement is <i>over</i> now, and I don’t want her to go on
brooding over it, and thinking her own little affairs of
enormous importance to the world in general. The best
thing now is to let her settle quietly down to everyday life
again.”</p>

<p>In the days that immediately ensued, however, Mrs. Tregaskis
saw with satisfaction that this aspiration appeared
likely to be realized.</p>

<p>Frances was calmly, silently happy.</p>

<p>She was more affectionate towards her guardian than
she had ever shown herself before, as though to demonstrate
that no added difference should join itself to that new,
deeper one of which she was more conscious than was
Bertha.</p>

<p>There was also much less exaggeration in her devotion to
her new creed than Mrs. Tregaskis had expected. Beyond
attending the daily Mass, as did all the lady boarders, and
spending a little while in the chapel every evening, Frances
appeared willing to spend the whole of the day in Bertha’s
company, a certain radiant serenity of outlook that now
encompassed her making her a charming companion.</p>

<p>She was delighted at the prospect of staying for one evening
with Hazel before the return journey to Cornwall, and
when, on the eve of departure, Bertha asked rather curiously
whether she minded leaving the convent, Frances replied
with a surprised look:</p>

<p>“No, not really. Not a bit. I hope I shall see them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
again one day, and you won’t mind my writing to Mère
Pauline from time to time, will you, Cousin Bertie?”</p>

<p>Bertha looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>A desire to test the reality of the steadfast-seeming happiness
that shone from the eyes of her ward made her say,
rather curtly:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear. Why this necessity for correspondence?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to write to her, that’s all; but, of course, not
if you don’t want me to,” said Frances placidly.</p>

<p>Bertha laughed, her good-humour suddenly restored.</p>

<p>“You can write if you want to, within reason. You are
not generally a good correspondent, Frances.”</p>

<p>And Frances said calmly that no, she was afraid she
wasn’t, except, perhaps, as regarded Rosamund.</p>

<p>Evidently the crisis was over, thought Bertha, not without
relief. There might come a reaction later on, but with
that she could trust herself to cope when at Porthlew.</p>

<p>They left the convent amid a crowd of auguries and farewells.</p>

<p>“Vous nous reviendrez, ma petite,” the Superior said as
she embraced Frances, and her voice had all the authority
of an assertion of fact.</p>

<p>“Oui ma Mère,” said Frances timidly. She was always
shy of speaking French, especially in front of her guardian,
who was apt to jeer good-humoredly at the schoolroom
<i>lingua-franca</i> of her wards.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais oui, mais oui!</i>” cried Bertha heartily. “<i>A
bientôt tout le monde!</i>” In the universal benevolence
which always pervades the welcome hour of departure from
a boring sojourn, she even added cordially:</p>

<p>“<i>Vous nous reverez l’année prochaine!</i>”</p>

<p>In the cab which was to take them to the station, the last
wave exchanged between Frances and the substantial form
of old Mrs. Mulholland, who stood agitating her arms like a
semaphore in the convent doorway, Frances turned inquiringly
to her guardian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Do you really think we shall come back next year,
Cousin Bertie? Did you mean for the Retreat?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Francie. If you’re very keen about it. We’ll
see.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Frances, with a sudden and most unusual
effusion, “you <i>are</i> so kind to me, Cousin Bertie. I don’t
feel I can ever be grateful enough to you. I wish I need
never—never do anything but just what you liked!”</p>

<p>Bertha was amazed, and also rather touched.</p>

<p>She laid her hand kindly on Frances’.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear little girl, that depends on yourself,
doesn’t it? But you’ve always been a good child, my
Francie, and I know the poor little conscience is responsible
for <i>most</i> of our differences of opinion, eh?”</p>

<p>She laughed a little.</p>

<p>“As long as you’re good and happy, that’s all I want,
my darling. One only lives for the younger generation,
you know, as one goes on. Hazel—and Hazel’s child, and,
I hope, some day, your children and Rosamund’s—that’s
all I care about.”</p>

<p>“I’m so <i>glad</i> we’re going to Hazel now,” said Frances
sympathetically.</p>

<p>Bertha squeezed her hand suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, think of it! To see her with a baby of
her own—to see little Richard Frederick at last!”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, as though afraid of her own emotion.</p>

<p>Frances reflected rather mournfully that Cousin Bertie
saw pathetically little of her daughter nowadays. On the
causes which had led to that estrangement she preferred not
to dwell. She had known very little of the difficulties surrounding
Hazel’s marriage, and the subject was never discussed
at Porthlew. Perhaps Frances, innocent and affectionate,
and looking upon Hazel as a sister only less dear
to her than Rosamund, unconsciously shrank from applying
the standards of her new-found creed to the position
held by the second Lady Marleswood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>She had by her a letter from Rosamund that added to her
happiness. Her sister had written:</p>

<p>“I do understand Francie, and I can’t help being glad
that you are a Catholic at last. Cousin Frederick has been
nicer about it that you would have supposed. It was he
who told Cousin Bertie that as things were they had no
right to forbid you, and he suddenly asked me last night if
you were happy. So I said you were. Unluckily, Miss
Blandflower was in the room, and said it was a case of live
and let live, or something of that sort, and you know how
angry she always makes him, so he said nothing more.
As a matter of fact, I think that live and let live <i>is</i> rather
what Cousin Frederick would like to do ... and that’s
what made him say you were to do as you liked. As for
me, I’m so thankful you really are happy about it all. I
think the convent sounds nice, and Mrs. Mulholland. I
wish I could see her, and thank her for being so nice to you.
Some day, darlingest, when we can go back home to the
Wye Valley and live together, we can ask her to come and
stay, can’t we? After all, it may not be so very far off, now
I am so nearly of age.”</p>

<p>Frances felt very happy as she gazed from the train
window, dreamily absorbed in her own thoughts. The Retreat,
the sense of illumination vouchsafed her, the directions
and instructions received from Father Anselm, and the
present joy of knowing herself in the Church where she had
longed to be, filled her mind. She did not want to think
of the future. If there was a lurking sense of apprehension,
as of some sacrifice that was to be demanded of her in
return for all that she had been given, a grievous dread of
inflicting pain, far sharper and stranger than any yet, upon
those whom she loved best and from whom she felt already
separated as though by an invisible gulf, Frances would not
dwell upon it.</p>

<p>Everyone was so kind to her, and she was happy, and
Cousin Bertie had understood that never, never of her own
free will would Frances grieve or disobey her, and had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
so good to her—and they were going to see Hazel and the
wonderful baby, Dickie.</p>

<p>And besides, had not Father Anselm and Mère Pauline
both said that she was to leave the future in God’s hands,
and not to look ahead at all, just yet?</p>

<p>Frances thought that it was nice to be told just what
one ought to do, and to feel such perfect confidence that the
advice given came, even though through human agency,
from a Divine source. It simplified everything very much.
Later on, perhaps, that simplification might be terribly
needed.</p>

<p>She resolutely put the thought from her.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Francie,” said Mrs. Tregaskis’ voice, tense
with excitement; “we’re just in. Of course, she won’t have
been able to meet us herself, I don’t suppose—just at
lunch-time——”</p>

<p>But she scanned the platform eagerly, all the same, even
as she spoke.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a double exclamation of joy,
as Hazel’s charming, laughing face appeared at the window
and her hands tugged at the stiff handle of the door.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAZEL had not changed.</p>

<p>That much was evident in the first instant, and
even after Frances had seen her, laughing and
triumphant, playing with her baby son or, securely radiant,
seated at the head of her husband’s table, she still felt Lady
Marleswood to be very much one with the little Hazel Tregaskis
of Porthlew days.</p>

<p>Her relations with Bertha, even, were singularly unaltered.
Frances knew that her guardian’s imperious rule
had weighed far more lightly on Hazel, in their nursery
days, than on either of her wards. She had opposed to it
a certain joyous pagan insensitiveness, for the most part too
indifferently good-humoured to resist, but quite capable of
overruling, lightly, merrily, yet more or less decisively, her
mother’s most trenchant bidding by her own calm quality of
self-reliance.</p>

<p>Now, in such security of happiness as Frances had never
dreamed of, her own way so amply justified as to need no
further explanation, Hazel could afford to listen with the
smiling surface docility that had always been hers, to
Bertha’s dictatorially-worded counsels for the welfare of
Dickie and her tempered approval of his nursery arrangements.</p>

<p>But Frances did not think that Hazel meant to follow
Cousin Bertie’s wise advice about not spoiling the little
darling, and making him learn at once that he must go to
sleep at the proper times without being coaxed. Hazel only
shook her tawny curls, and said in a tone of comical resignation
that she was sure Dickie was going to be dreadfully
spoiled, and she only hoped he would have a little brother to
help keep him in order, and not an adoring sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Sir Guy was very polite to Mrs. Tregaskis, and very kind
to Frances. It was he, Hazel eagerly told her cousin, who
had suggested that Frances should stay with them in the
summer and be taken through her first season by Lady
Marleswood.</p>

<p>Frances was impressed and almost overawed by such
kindness. Sir Guy had hardly appeared to notice her existence
at Porthlew, but he seemed quite different now, under
his own roof, with no atmosphere of strain and disapproval
to contend against.</p>

<p>“Does he know about me?” Frances asked Hazel rather
timidly that evening.</p>

<p>Hazel had come into her cousin’s bedroom in a blue silk
négligée and sat on the floor, just as she used to do in her
blue cotton kimono at Porthlew.</p>

<p>“What about you, except that you’re a darling, and just
like my very own sister?” demanded Lady Marleswood.</p>

<p>“Being a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course, and we both think it perfectly splendid,”
declared Hazel lightly.</p>

<p>Frances felt relief at the very lightness of her tone.</p>

<p>“Was there a lot of difficulty about it? Were they all
very vexed?” asked Hazel sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Rather vexed. Cousin Bertie was very, very kind, of
course—and Rosamund understood, and didn’t think I
wanted to be separate or—or different or anything—you
know what I mean, though I can’t explain it at all well.
But, of course, they didn’t like it. Naturally.”</p>

<p>“Now why ‘naturally’? What had it got to do with
anyone but yourself? If it makes you any happier, why on
earth shouldn’t you be a Roman Catholic to-day and a Primitive
Methodist to-morrow, if you want to? I’ve no
patience with this never letting people run their own show,”
declared Lady Marleswood.</p>

<p>“It was very difficult to know what to do,” rather
solemnly said Frances.</p>

<p>“That’s so like you, Francie dearest. <i>I</i> shouldn’t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
seen the least difficulty in it. Do whatever you want to do,
and whatever you think best. Then you take your own
risks and have nobody but yourself to blame if things go
wrong. But I don’t believe they do go wrong. Look at
me!”</p>

<p>Frances looked—at the radiant blooming face of little
Dickie’s mother.</p>

<p>“I’ve never,” said Hazel earnestly, “never for one single
minute, regretted that I took my own way, Frances. I’m
happier than I’ve ever been in my life, and even if I lost
Guy and the baby to-morrow, I should still think it had been
worth while.”</p>

<p>Frances looked at her.</p>

<p>“You’ve not changed a bit, Hazel. I feel just as if you
and Rosamund had been to some grown-up party and then
you’d come into my room at Porthlew to tell me all about
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” cried Hazel delightedly. “I should hate
it if you all thought I’d changed and become quite different
just because I’m so happy. Francie, I <i>do</i> want Rosamund
and you to be as happy as I am. It seems unfair that you
shouldn’t be, when you’re both so much better than I am.
Is Rosamund going to marry Morris Severing?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. He’s not nearly good enough for her.
We’ll find someone much nicer—a very clever man who
writes books or something, I think—and when they’re married
you can live with her most of the time, till you marry
yourself. Oh, Francie, I can’t help it—I want to see <i>all</i>
the people I love married now—it’s so much the nicest
thing to be!”</p>

<p>“It depends,” faltered Frances, colouring.</p>

<p>Hazel looked at her with her shrewd, sympathetic gaze.
She had that odd degree of intuition that the most frankly
self-absorbed natures often display.</p>

<p>“Francie,” she said slowly, “do you want to become a
nun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Frances coloured helplessly under the unexpected bit of
penetration.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—oh, Hazel—what made you think that?
I haven’t said one word—not for a long time yet,” she
stammered incoherently.</p>

<p>“I’m not exactly surprised,” remarked her cousin calmly.
“You were always much too good for this world, darling;
but do you think you’d be happy in a convent?”</p>

<p>“<i>Of course</i> I should be happy. But I don’t know if—if
they’d even have me. Oh, Hazel, it makes it all seem so
much more real when we talk about it like this. I’ve not
told anybody at all—not even Rosamund.”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell a soul,” promised Hazel. “I don’t know
anything about convents at all, but there are some sisters
who call for subscriptions sometimes at Marleswood, and
they always look very nice and happy.”</p>

<p>“Nuns are always happy,” said Frances seriously.</p>

<p>“Are they? I wish I knew more about them, and what
sort of life they have to lead. I suppose it’s nice and peaceful
and holy, if you like that sort of thing. Do you feel as
though you had a vocation, or whatever it is, Frances?”</p>

<p>Frances said nothing, only looked at Hazel with large,
distressed eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m talking of what I know nothing about,” declared
Lady Marleswood, kissing her affectionately. “I won’t
bother you about it, but if they worry you at Porthlew, when
they know, you can come to us just whenever you like and
for as long as you like. Nobody shall say anything to you,
and you can go to church all day if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hazel, how nice you are!”</p>

<p>“Good-night, Francie darling. Do remember that the
only thing is to follow one’s own convictions <i>quite</i> regardless
of anything and everyone. I know it sounds dreadful,
but look at me! I’m a living example of the advantages of
self-will. Now I must go and say good-night to mother.”</p>

<p>Hazel left Frances to the realization that her hitherto
unspoken desire had gained the strangest degree of life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
substance from the mere facts of having been put into
words, and received almost as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“Hazel seemed to think it quite natural, and not at all
dreadful,” Frances thought to herself. “Perhaps Cousin
Bertie won’t mind as much as I think she’s going to. I
know I’m a moral coward, because I’m more afraid of telling
her, for fear she should be angry, than of telling Rosamund,
who’ll only be dreadfully unhappy. But I needn’t
think of it yet. Father Anselm said I was not to think of
the future at all, or to make plans....”</p>

<p>She lost herself in surmises, that almost amounted to
certainties, as to the interpretation her confessor had put
upon her timidly vague references to her own future.
That the shrewd little French Superior had penetrated
her scarcely apprehended secret, Frances felt hardly any
doubt.</p>

<p>“They’ll tell me what to do when the time comes,” she
thought with a quickly beating heart, and remembered thankfully
her new-found allegiance.</p>

<p>The day following, Mrs. Tregaskis and Frances went
down to Cornwall.</p>

<p>Frances felt as though she had been away for a lifetime,
and had to combat an unreasonable tendency to astonishment
at finding her surroundings utterly unchanged.</p>

<p>It was a relief to her that no allusion was made at first to
that change in herself of which she felt so acutely conscious.</p>

<p>Frederick, rather as though the words were dragged out
of him under protest, asked for news of Hazel, and Miss
Blandflower squeaked ecstatic inquiries about the baby.</p>

<p>“Is the dear little man like Hazel?”</p>

<p>“Not very like her,” said Bertha rather slowly. “His
eyes are dark blue, for one thing.”</p>

<p>Everyone remembered Sir Guy’s remarkably dark blue
eyes, with the apparent exception of the unfortunate Minnie,
who exclaimed in a high-pitched key of astonishment:</p>

<p>“Now where can he get that from? Yours are so very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
brown, dear Mrs. Tregaskis, and Hazel’s, as we know,
match her name.”</p>

<p>“By some extraordinary coincidence,” said Frederick’s
disagreeable voice, “the child has inherited his father’s
eyes.”</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower looked confused, laughed a good deal
in a nervous way, and made a characteristic attempt to retrieve
her verbal footing by embarking upon a disastrous
quotation:</p>

<p>“Ah well, it’s a wise child that——”</p>

<p>“Give me a bun, Minnie,” said Bertha in loud, commanding
tones. “I be starvin’ for my tay. Why, Francie and I
haven’t had a blow-out like this for I don’t know how long.
Tea at the convent consisted of stewed twigs and a Marie
biscuit, eh, Frances? that is to say, when we got any all.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t very much,” Frances admitted reluctantly,
and without smiling.</p>

<p>“There was not indeed! And that Mrs. Mulholland has
the appetite of a cormorant, positively.”</p>

<p>Few feminine indictments can be much more virulent
than the charge of “having an appetite,” and there was a
distinct quality of venom in Mrs. Tregaskis’ tone.</p>

<p>“Is that the one Mrs. Severing talked about?” asked
Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Yes, as though she were her dearest friend. Poor
Nina’s gush is sometimes apt to be misleading,” laughed
Bertha tolerantly. “Has she been over here, Rosamund?”</p>

<p>“She came yesterday, to see if you were back.”</p>

<p>“Any news?”</p>

<p>“There’s to be a concert at Polwerrow on the twentieth,
and she wants to take us all. She’ll call for us in the car
and bring us back.”</p>

<p>“Excellent. A deep draught of music is just what I
want. Anyone good coming down? I suppose so, or Nina
wouldn’t condescend.”</p>

<p>“Some violinist—I can’t remember his name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“You wouldn’t!” laughed Bertha. “Well, my dear,
that’ll be very jolly. I love an outing, and there’ll be plenty
of room in the car for all of us.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Severing was kind enough to suggest my coming
too—room for a small one,” said Minnie agitatedly. “Of
course I said it wasn’t to be thought of for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Minnie, you know you like music, and you always go
with us to any decent concert at Polwerrow,” said Bertha
patiently. “Of course you’ll come.”</p>

<p>Under cover of the protests, incoherent objections, and
final yielding, which were always part and parcel of any invitation
issued to and accepted by Miss Blandflower, Rosamund
and Frances made their escape.</p>

<p>Their long talk together left Frances very happy. She
gave Rosamund no such confidence as that sudden, unpremeditated
one which had been drawn from her by Hazel’s
matter of fact suggestion, but nevertheless she was all but
unconscious of any reticence.</p>

<p>It was to Rosamund that she could best pour out the
story of her new experiences, and the fullness of Rosamund’s
sympathy gave no hint of any sense of exclusion.</p>

<p>If a division of the ways had been reached neither was
conscious of it. To Rosamund, her sister’s happiness, in
itself unintelligible, became merely a subject for rejoicing,
and the ready congratulations she gave out of her affection
needed no deeper source to fill Frances with tender gratitude.</p>

<p>They drew nearer together in the very difference that
might have separated them for a time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONLY the Polwerrow concert broke the monotony
of the months that followed. It was not a very
great event, but it was on that evening that Rosamund,
by one of the agonized intuitions that are among the
penalties borne by the too highly-strung, first began to suspect
what Frances had in mind.</p>

<p>They drove to Polwerrow in Mrs. Severing’s car, and
made their way into the reserved stalls selected by Nina.</p>

<p>“Don’t push, as the elephant said to the flea when the
animals went in two by two,” Miss Blandflower muttered
to herself, but, as usual, no one paid any attention to her.</p>

<p>They listened to much inferior singing: Bertha with a
look of well-bred tolerance, Nina with closed eyes and a
small, excruciated frown.</p>

<p>Rosamund sat next to Frances.</p>

<p>She wondered idly what dreams her little sister wove into
the playing of the famous violinist. Frances’ face was absorbed,
and her eyes quite unseeing. Rosamund thought
that she looked very happy, as though her dreams were
pleasant ones. Was she thinking of the ideals and aspirations
newly revealed to her in the Catholic Church, Rosamund
wondered. That Frances was finding the greatest
happiness that her short life had as yet known, she felt no
doubt, but she also wondered with quite unconscious cynicism
how long that happiness would continue. Once received
into the Church, it seemed to Rosamund, there appeared
to be nothing further to which her sister could aspire,
except, perhaps, to live quite near a Catholic church.</p>

<p>“There isn’t one anywhere very near in the Wye Valley,”
Rosamund reflected. “I wonder if Francie will mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
that, when we live there together. But she can go to her
convent sometimes and stay there for a little while, if she
wants to. They were kind and nice to her. She likes the
convent.”</p>

<p>And it was then that there flashed across Rosamund’s
consciousness the first sickening, unreasoning suspicion,
carrying with it all the anguish of certainty, that Frances
would want to go and be a nun.</p>

<p>Shocked, as from a physical pang, she held on to the arms
of her stall as though afraid of falling.</p>

<p>There was a pause in the music, and a faint sound or
two as of uncertain applause. Rosamund saw Miss Blandflower
begin to clap her hands enthusiastically, then turn
doubtful eyes on Mrs. Severing, who had not moved, and
begin to fumble with her gloves as though she had never
meant to do anything else. The plaintive, poignant strains
of the violin began again.</p>

<p>Rosamund suddenly felt that she dared not look at Frances,
for fear of seeing in her face some mysterious confirmation
of her own thoughts.</p>

<p>For a little while she argued with herself. It was absurd
to jump at conclusions. Frances had never spoken, or given
any hint, of wishing to become a nun. And even supposing
she were infatuated with the idea for a time, her guardian
would be the last person to encourage such a step. It would
all be stopped and forbidden, and Frances would never be
wilfully disobedient.</p>

<p>Such a thing could not happen—no one entered a convent
nowadays. It was in medieval times that girls of one’s
own class became nuns—not nowadays. A convent had
been a refuge from the world, then. Involuntarily Rosamund
wondered whether it would not present itself in exactly
that light to Frances, now. “But she’s not going to—she
can’t. Why, it would mean shutting herself up away
from me—for the whole of her life,” thought Rosamund
wildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>She tried to look at it reasonably, to tell herself that
this full-grown certainty which had suddenly sprung into
being within her, was without any foundation in fact. She
reminded herself of Cousin Bertie’s favourite advice, not
to cross bridges before they were reached. But Rosamund
happened to possess that fundamental form of sincerity
which cannot blind itself to its own inner vision, and not
all the wisdom of common sense and of Cousin Bertie’s
optimistic philosophy, weighed against that one unreasoning
flash of intuition.</p>

<p>A sudden craving for reassurance seized her uncontrollably.</p>

<p>She looked at Frances.</p>

<p>The last notes of the violin died away, and this time
everyone broke into applause at once, and Miss Blandflower
was able to clap fearlessly and noisily with the others.</p>

<p>Under cover of it all Rosamund leant towards her sister.</p>

<p>“Francie,” she said urgently, “you wouldn’t ever want to
be a nun, would you? Promise me you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Perhaps there was some faint ray of hope underlying the
wording of Rosamund’s sudden appeal. For it was with a
new and even more bitter pang that the last certainty came
to her, as Frances, without a single word of answer, raised
startled, almost terrified eyes to hers, and as their looks met,
blushed a deep, painful scarlet.</p>

<p>Words between them were unnecessary, nor could either
have spoken.</p>

<p>The concert went on, and Rosamund wished that it could
never stop. In the blur of sound which seemed to surround
her, she did not think that she would ever realize what had
happened. It would all remain chaotic and unreal.</p>

<p>There was a little movement beside her, and Frances’
small, soft hand sought hers, like that of a child seeking
reassurance.</p>

<p>They did not look at one another, but for a moment their
hands clung together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Shall we make a move now, before the crush?” said
Mrs. Severing wearily. “Some of these renderings are
really rather more than I can stand.”</p>

<p>Bertha shrugged her shoulders very slightly, and looked
at Rosamund and Frances.</p>

<p>“Come out of the moon, Rosamund. You don’t look half
awake, my child. We want to get out of this before everyone
begins to crowd. Come along, Minnie, come along.”</p>

<p>Rosamund, in a dream, followed the wide, efficient figure
of her guardian. Miss Blandflower had jammed a small
rabbit-skin tie into the back of her stall, and, wrestling with
it in an agony, was blocking the exit for both Frances and
Mrs. Severing.</p>

<p>“Oh, my fur—dear me, <i>isn’t</i> that tiresome, now! So
sorry—do excuse me....”</p>

<p>It was not difficult to conjecture that Miss Blandflower
was trampling recklessly over the feet on either side of her
in her endeavours to rescue the rabbit skin.</p>

<p>As she left the hall with Mrs. Tregaskis, Rosamund
heard the last glee begin, and exclamations issuing in the
penetrating husky falsetto which was peculiar to Miss
Blandflower when whispering:</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for me—but I’m afraid you can’t get out—or
could you squeeze past? This wretched fur of mine.
Simply beyond the beyonds, isn’t it? Wait a minute—the
deed is done—no, it isn’t—false alarm. Oh, how dreadful
of me this is ... you’ll never forgive me, I’m afraid.
Now then, a long pull and a strong pull....”</p>

<p>The door swung to behind Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Where are the others?” asked her guardian.</p>

<p>Cousin Bertie always made her way through any crowd
without any difficulty at all, partly because her bulk was considerable,
and partly from a certain pleasant authoritative
way she had of saying, “Thank you—if you’ll just let me
get past, please—thank you so much.” Rosamund had
noticed long ago that very few people were ever proof
against that firm civility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Aren’t they coming?” said Mrs. Tregaskis, when they
were in the outer hall.</p>

<p>“Miss Blandflower’s fur got caught into her chair or
something, and the others couldn’t get past.”</p>

<p>“Wretched Minnie! Now they’ll have to wait until the
end of that chorus—Nina will never come out in the middle
of it. How cross she’ll be. Well, Rosamund, you and I
may as well sit down and wait for them here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis established herself on the red plush sofa
underneath an enlarged photograph of Mme. Clara Butt,
and made room for Rosamund beside her.</p>

<p>“You look rather tired, old lady,” she said kindly. Rosamund
felt suddenly grateful for the kindness of her voice
and said:</p>

<p>“A little, Cousin Bertie.”</p>

<p>“A real deep draught of music always gives <i>me</i> a fresh
lease of life,” remarked Mrs. Tregaskis, drawing a deep
breath that expanded her broad chest yet more. “Not that
we heard very much to-night, but the violin was good, of
course. Funny that music doesn’t mean more to you two
children, Rosamund. Your mother was wonderful. But
still, I hope you and Frances enjoyed this evening.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Rosamund colourlessly.</p>

<p>Her guardian looked rather dissatisfied.</p>

<p>“Why so down in the mouth, eh?” she asked genially.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis was always very quick to detect an atmosphere.</p>

<p>Rosamund hesitated.</p>

<p>She partly shared Frances’ old childish feeling that Mrs.
Tregaskis must always get just that answer which she expected
to get, to her kindly, peremptory questionings, and
she was partly actuated by an intense, miserable need of
reassurance that made her turn even to a source which she
felt to be unlikely.</p>

<p>“I’m feeling rather worried about Frances,” she said
rather nervously, knowing that it was not a propitious beginning.
Her tendency to torment herself and the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
household on the subject of imaginary anxieties about
Frances’ health or spirits had been genially but quite implacably
combated by Mrs. Tregaskis ever since their first
arrival at Porthlew.</p>

<p>She gave a half-humorous sigh.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, I’m sorry to hear that. But it isn’t anything
so very new, is it? You’ve pulled a long face over
Frances ever since I can remember you both, when she was
a little scared thing who didn’t dare call her soul her own.
I don’t mean you ever bullied her, my dear—but there is
such a thing as over-solicitude, you know.”</p>

<p>Accustomed though Rosamund was to her guardian’s
kindly banter on the subject of Frances, she had never
ceased to resent it with the wounded fury of an over-sensitive
child.</p>

<p>Instantly she resolved that it would be impossible to tell
Cousin Bertie of her new-born dread.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Tregaskis, “what is it this time? Is
she tired, or has she got a cold, or has Nina been hurting
her feelings? Out with it.”</p>

<p>Rosamund asked herself desperately: “<i>Why</i> was I such
a fool as to begin this?” and aloud said in a sort of uncertain
tone which to her own ears sounded very unconvincing:</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of her having become a Catholic,
and all that. Whether—whether she’ll be happier now, or—want
anything more.”</p>

<p>It was the nearest she could get to the sudden terror that
had lain like lead at her heart ever since that silent interchange
of looks with Frances.</p>

<p>“Want anything more!” Mrs. Tregaskis repeated rather
derisively. “Are you afraid of her asking to join the Salvation
Army next? Upon my word, Rosamund, I think
better of the child than you do. She was very silly and
wrong-headed about it, but at least it was all perfectly genuine,
and she’s in earnest about the religious part of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know she is. That’s just it.”</p>

<p>“My dear, don’t be a little goose. She’s ’verted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
faith that your mother was born into, after all, and it’s
perfectly natural that she should take the whole thing very
much to heart and prove a trifle <i>exaltée</i> about it all. It’s a
most wholesome symptom, I assure you, and one I’ve been
watching for. Presently there’ll be a reaction, and then
she’ll settle down normally, I hope. But you’ll do her much
more harm than good if you sit like a cat watching a mouse—waiting
for every sign. It will only make her self-conscious.”</p>

<p>Under the flow of so much common sense, such sound,
kindly advice, Rosamund had nothing to say. A creeping
sensation of numbness invaded her mind. She ceased to
feel acutely unhappy or apprehensive.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis, solid, competent, looking at her with
rather puzzled eyes, seemed a sufficient bulwark against any
such ephemeral fears as those which lay at Rosamund’s
heart.</p>

<p>“My dear little girl,” said Bertha earnestly, “don’t go
looking for trouble. I’ll give you a piece of advice which
has helped me over some very rough bits of ground, rougher
than any you’re ever likely to meet with, please God:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘Look up, and not down;</div>
<div class="verse">Look out, and not in;</div>
<div class="verse">Look forward, and not back,</div>
<div class="indent3">Lend a hand.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>That’s pretty well coloured my whole life, Rosamund. I
wasn’t as old as you are now when I first read those words,
and I’ve never forgotten them.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, and Mrs. Tregaskis’ fine
eyes grew for once introspective.</p>

<p>Then she roused herself briskly and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Here are the others at last! Well, Nina, what happened
to you?”</p>

<p>The drive home passed almost in silence. Mrs. Severing
was annoyed at having been delayed, and replied coldly to
all Bertha’s cheery assurances of enjoyment that much was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
lacking to the more modern interpreters of music. Had
not Bertie felt it so? Ah well, perhaps not!</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower, contrite and incoherent, was responsible
for most of the conversation, such as it was.</p>

<p>That night Rosamund and Frances exchanged only a very
few words. Rosamund indeed did not feel that words were
needed to emphasize the unhappy certainty that was hers,
and any discussion seemed to distress Frances, who said
stammeringly and with tears in her eyes that nothing would
be done for a long, long time, and <i>even</i> Father Anselm and
Mère Pauline didn’t know yet.</p>

<p>“Have you thought of what Cousin Bertie will say?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frances, the sudden whitening of her face
belying the courage of her tone. “It’s no use thinking
about that until the time comes.”</p>

<p>“And when will it come?” Rosamund asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose Father Anselm will settle that.
He is my director. Oh, Rosamund, it’s such a relief to
know that one can’t do wrong as long as one is obedient. I
just have to submit my own private judgment to what the
Church teaches through her priests, and it’s such a comfort.”</p>

<p>Rosamund marvelled.</p>

<p>But she saw that Frances, in spite of the lurking apprehensions
for the future which she so resolutely tried to put
from her, was essentially happy.</p>

<p>It seemed to Rosamund now that the weeks were slipping
by with incredible rapidity. She no longer thought of
Morris Severing, and was occasionally ashamed of her own
oblivion. But the honesty which in her was innate, did
not allow her to falsify her own scale of relative values, and
she knew that Morris was relegated to the unimportance of
an episode.</p>

<p>After a little while she induced in herself a sort of surface
sense of reassurance about Frances. No one else ever
hinted at any thought of religious vocation, and Frances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
never spoke of it. Rosamund thought wistfully that perhaps
she had abandoned the idea and sought to confirm the
trembling hope that sometimes rose within her, in tiny ways
that she strove to persuade herself would mean a great deal.
She sometimes spoke to Frances of “next winter,” or asked
if she meant to get new frocks for going, later on, to stay
with Hazel in London, and Frances always answered naturally
and without demur. But Rosamund did not dare to
make any allusion to their old plan of going back to live
together in the Wye Valley.</p>

<p>It seemed as if life at Porthlew would always consist of
the same uneventful routine, and Rosamund, far from feeling
it tedious, found herself regarding each monotonous day
as it slipped past in the light of a respite.</p>

<p>But the sword of Damocles fell at last, when her anxiety
was almost dormant.</p>

<p>“Francie, my child, there’s quite a large mail for you
to-day,” cheerily exclaimed Bertha, distributing the letters.
“Two fat envelopes.”</p>

<p>“I always say that Frances mustn’t expect to <i>get</i> many
letters, because she seldom <i>writes</i> any,” said Miss Blandflower
with an air of sapience.</p>

<p>Frances took her correspondence without saying anything,
but something in her face brought Rosamund’s every apprehension
to life again in one unreasoning rush of terror.</p>

<p>She restrained herself with difficulty from making inquiries
of her sister when breakfast was over, but in the
course of the morning Frances sought Rosamund in the
garden of her own accord.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard from Father Anselm and from Mère Pauline,”
she said gently. She looked nervous, but not at all
agitated. It was as though she were stating the accomplishment
of some long-expected project.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you’d written to them,” said Rosamund
dully.</p>

<p>“I thought it wasn’t any use to say anything till I had the
answers,” Frances said apologetically. “They might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
told me to put the whole thing out of my mind, you know.”</p>

<p>“They—they don’t do that, then?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve brought the letters for you to read, Rosamund.”</p>

<p>The Prior of Twickenham’s letter was not a long one,
and struck Rosamund as that of a peculiarly simple and
unworldly man. He told Frances that he had long ago
guessed the destiny which God held in store for her, and that
he believed her vocation to the religious life to be a real one.
She must speak to her guardians and obtain their consent before
taking any step. Meanwhile, she was to write freely
and to count upon his prayers that her decision might be
guided and blessed from above. There was little else in the
letter, but something in its tone of matter-of-fact acceptance
frightened Rosamund.</p>

<p>Mère Pauline wrote at much greater length. She congratulated
Frances on “the great honour she had received”
and promised her many prayers, but after that she became
at once characteristically practical in her advice. If
Frances’ director thought with her that she was suited to
their own form of convent life, then Mère Pauline would
be very glad to receive her, and meanwhile Frances must
try and fit herself to be of great use. She must take care of
her health, so as to be strong, and she must study, so as to
be able to work, and above all, she must not neglect prayer
and meditation. And, added Mère Pauline in a matter-of-fact
postscript, it might be no bad plan to set about learning
Latin, for greater facility in the recitation of the Holy
Office. But she need not impress upon her dear child that,
above all, must the feelings of that family, so soon to be
called upon for so great a sacrifice, be tenderly considered.</p>

<p>“Frances!” said Rosamund aghast. “She writes as
though the whole thing were settled.”</p>

<p>Her little sister looked at her with compassionate, loving
eyes, and said nothing.</p>

<p>But Rosamund knew, more surely than any words could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
have told her, that in effect, the whole thing, as she had said,
was settled.</p>

<p>The conviction remained with her even when it became
obvious that the main conflict was yet to come.</p>

<p>“When are you going to tell <i>them</i>?” she asked later.</p>

<p>“Soon,” said Frances.</p>

<p>But that Frances’ courage had not yet proved equal to
the avowal was made manifest some weeks later when Rosamund,
unnoticed in the window, heard part of a conversation
between Frederick Tregaskis and his wife.</p>

<p>“I shall want the trap in the morning, Frederick. I’ve
got to drive Francie into Polwerrow.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Church, my dear man, church. It’s some holy Roman
feast or other, and I promised the child she should get in
to Mass if possible.”</p>

<p>“Very unreasonable,” growled Frederick.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d say so, dear,” patiently replied Bertha,
who was apt to display tolerance of her ward’s inconvenient
religion in proportion as her husband grumbled at it. “I
should have thought Sundays quite enough, myself.”</p>

<p>“As to that,” replied the disconcerting Frederick, “she
pays for her own cab on Sundays and doesn’t inconvenience
anyone but herself. I’m not saying anything to her Sunday
expeditions.”</p>

<p>“Well, well—it’s something to have peace. The child
is perfectly happy, and has looked much better since she
stopped fretting. Thank goodness, the religious crisis, since
apparently she had to have one, is safely over and done
with.”</p>

<p>Rosamund wrung her hands together in silent anguish.</p>

<p>She did not know what Frances’ latest decision might
portend, but there seemed to stretch before her a despairing
vista of pain and separation, based on principles that appeared
to her but as the shadow of a dream.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was in a very little while that Mrs. Tregaskis became
fully aware of the fallacy in her hopeful theory that
the crisis was over for the younger of her two adopted
daughters.</p>

<p>“I can’t think how I could ever have been so blind. Give
children an inch and they’ll take an ell! I might have
guessed that Frances would develop some fanatic notion of
this kind. Why <i>did</i> I ever let her go to that wretched convent?
She’s thought of nothing else ever since, and now she
tells me that they’re ‘willing to receive her’ into the novitiate
there. Willing, indeed! I should think they were!”</p>

<p>“Of course, Bertie dear, if you let her get under the
influence of priests and nuns, what else can you expect?”
inquired Mrs. Severing.</p>

<p>“You can’t reproach me more than I do myself,” said
Bertha vehemently. “Though I must say, dearest, it’s
rather laughable coming from you, since you were the very
person who urged me to send the child to make that Retreat,
and even insisted on going with her yourself, if you remember.”</p>

<p>Nina looked at her greatest friend for a moment in
silence, and then said in the compassionate tones of a ministering
angel:</p>

<p>“My poor dear! I can see that you’re so much on edge
about the whole thing, you simply don’t know what you’re
saying. I am so sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Nina,” said Mrs. Tregaskis rather dryly.
“It would be more to the point, perhaps, if you knew what
to say to Frances. Do you think you could put a little
sense into her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The inquiry was more than tinged with doubtfulness, as
Bertha eyed her friend coldly, and Mrs. Severing, with a
sudden access of austerity, replied in accents grown markedly
remote:</p>

<p>“Really, Bertie, you mustn’t ask me to come between
Frances and her conscience. I have a very great deal of
influence with her, as you know, and I shouldn’t care to take
such a responsibility on myself. The child’s instinct is a
very pure and holy one, and personally I can’t see why she
shouldn’t follow her own inspiration. It may very well be a
God-given one.”</p>

<p>“I never heard such an outrageous piece of nonsense in
my life,” declared Mrs. Tregaskis, for once losing control
of her temper. “Anything to save trouble, Nina. That’s
you all over. Always the line of least resistance! Well,
I’m not going to let Frances ruin her life by taking a step
of which she doesn’t even realize the meaning, before she’s
seen anything of life. Even Roman Catholics insist on their
daughters waiting until they’re of age before letting them
enter a convent.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Frances isn’t your daughter, Bertie, which
may make all the difference. Though really,” said Nina
dreamily, “it doesn’t seem to matter much nowadays, since
the younger generation takes its own line without reference
to any standards but its own. The myth of parental authority
is altogether done away with.”</p>

<p>“Frances isn’t made of the same stuff as Morris, my dear.
Well, if you won’t or can’t help me, I must tackle the situation
myself. It isn’t the first time I’ve taken on a tough job
single-handed, and it won’t be the last, I don’t suppose. Ah
well! it’s better to wear out than to rust out!”</p>

<p>In the ensuing weeks at Porthlew it appeared not unlikely
that the process of wearing out would extend to other members
of the household in addition to Mrs. Tregaskis.</p>

<p>Frances, white and exalted, spent her days in writing to
the Prior of Twickenham and to Mère Pauline and the
major part of her nights in tears. Only Rosamund realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
how inflexible was the determination that underlay her sobbing
protests.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower bleated frightened auguries and ejaculatory
condemnations, and Rosamund upheld Frances passionately
and told herself that it would only be an experiment,
and that, of course, Frances would never, never stay
at the convent for life.</p>

<p>“Will they let you come away if you want to?” she asked
tensely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frances almost violently. “That’s what a
novitiate is for.”</p>

<p>“Will you promise to come away if you find you’ve made
a mistake?”</p>

<p>“I promise.”</p>

<p>“Then Cousin Bertie ought to let you go,” declared Rosamund,
sick with misery. “If it’s the only thing that will
make you happy.”</p>

<p>For answer Frances began to cry again, piteously and
silently, as she used to cry when a child.</p>

<p>Rosamund, with the same despairing instinct of rebellion
and impotent protection that had been hers in the days when
she had resisted Bertha Tregaskis’ kindness to the little orphan
sisters, put her arms round Frances.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” she whispered. “I’ll go to Cousin Frederick,
and he must <i>make</i> Cousin Bertie give in. They’ve no
real right to forbid you.”</p>

<p>She sought Frederick Tregaskis in the study which had
become his almost permanent refuge from the strained atmosphere
now prevalent at Porthlew.</p>

<p>He looked up angrily, and her heart failed her, but she
began steadily enough.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to speak to you about Frances——”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to hear you. Everyone comes to speak
to me about Frances. When I come into this room, it is in
order to avoid being spoken to about Frances.”</p>

<p>“I know it is,” said Rosamund desperately. “But I only
want to say one thing, Cousin Frederick——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Then don’t say it in here. Come into some other part
of the house.”</p>

<p>Rosamund followed the exasperated Frederick into the
hall, where he made a sound expressive of disgust on seeing
Miss Blandflower, wearing a large pair of yellow wash-leather
gloves, arranging flowers. Rosamund, however, was
not even aware of the governess’s presence.</p>

<p>“Frances is breaking her heart. She thinks that she is
meant to be a nun and that she ought not to wait indefinitely.
Will you give her leave to go? I don’t believe she’ll stay
there long——”</p>

<p>“I’ve told her already that I’m not in a position to give
or refuse leave. She’s no daughter of mine.”</p>

<p>“It will satisfy her conscience if you will just say that
she has your consent,” urged Rosamund.</p>

<p>Minnie, listening hard in the background, muttered frantically:
“Conscience in truth makes cowards of us all; and
how she can even speak of such a thing!”</p>

<p>“She can have my consent for what it’s worth,” said
Frederick Tregaskis. “But she must fight it out for herself
with your Cousin Bertha.”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it——”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s the worst of it! And the sooner she puts
an end to it the better. This house is like a—shambles,”
said Frederick in tones which convinced Miss Blandflower,
who did not know what the word meant, that a shambles
must be some recondite form of impropriety. She became
very red and uttered a shocked and protesting titter, which
had the effect of drawing Frederick’s eye upon her for a
searing moment before he again retreated to the impregnable
study.</p>

<p>But Rosamund took comfort with her when she went back
to Frances.</p>

<p>“If it’s only Cousin Bertie,” said Frances rather surprisingly,
“I don’t mind so much. I know I’m frightened of
her, though she’s so very, very kind, but Father Anselm says
that my first duty is to God, and that it’s not as if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
were really my mother. He thinks I ought to enter now.”</p>

<p>“It’s only an experiment,” cried Rosamund entreatingly,
but with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>And Frances would not contradict her.</p>

<p>The days dragged by in an atmosphere of eternal discomfort.</p>

<p>Bertha’s face showed signs of wearing and of wakeful
nights, but she remained determinedly normal and even
cheerful. Miss Blandflower loyally supported her with
chirping and obvious contributions to the lagging conversation
at meals and in the evenings, and even Frances, pale-faced
and with scared, sorrowful eyes, made her evident and
rather piteous attempts to behave as usual in the face of a
mental struggle that she felt to be only the strength-sapping
preliminary to an impending crisis of upheaval.</p>

<p>Rosamund, supersensitive to atmosphere, and bearing the
weight of her sister’s dumb unhappiness as well as that of
her own rebellious, apprehensive misery, began to feel that
the only hope of relief for any of them lay in the decisive
cutting of the Gordian knot.</p>

<p>“This can’t go on, you know,” she said ruthlessly to
Frances. “What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p>“Waiting for?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you think Cousin Bertie will ever give in?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then do you mean to put the whole thing out of your
mind till you’re much older—say about twenty-five—and
just submit, till then?”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, Rosamund felt convinced that such a
course had not presented itself to Frances.</p>

<p>“No,” said Frances with the inflexible note in her childish
voice that Porthlew was learning to dread. “It wouldn’t
be right to do that. Father Anselm is a very wise priest
and very holy, and he says I ought to be brave and go now.
If I am unfaithful to my vocation, it may be taken away
from me.”</p>

<p>Rosamund, quite unconscious of humour, reflected on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
extreme convenience of such a solution. She did not believe
that any Divine call had come to her sister, but she
felt convinced that Frances would know no rest until she
had tested by experience the reality of her religious vocation.</p>

<p>“You’d better go, I think,” she said abruptly.</p>

<p>“Go now?” Frances whitened. “Then I should have to
run away.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Francie! If you say, definitely, that you’re
going to the convent no one can stop you. They can’t lock
you up or use brute force.”</p>

<p>The moral courage involved in such a course seemed unattainable
to Frances. The psychological moment, however,
for which we all, consciously or unconsciously, wait
when on the brink of a vital decision, came at last.</p>

<p>There came an instant, unexpectedly even to herself, when
Frances looked up from a letter received by the afternoon
post, and said suddenly:</p>

<p>“Cousin Bertie, Mère Pauline writes that I had better go
to the convent some time next month, if I can get my things
ready. I—I want you to let me fix a date.”</p>

<p>Her heart was beating so that she felt as though she must
suffocate.</p>

<p>“I have already written to Mère Pauline, Frances, and
she knows quite well that I do not think you old enough or
strong enough or wise enough to take such a step as that, at
any rate for the present.”</p>

<p>“When <i>would</i> you let me, then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my child. When you’ve learnt to be less
self-righteous and self-opinionated at home I shall think
you better fitted to try and undertake a life of mortification
and humility.”</p>

<p>Then Bertha suddenly relapsed into her normal tones of
hearty kindness.</p>

<p>“My dear, I hate playing the heavy guardian and talking
to you like this, but these people have worked you up into
taking the whole thing <i>au grand serieux</i>, until one doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
know what other tone to adopt. Can’t you be content to
trust me, Francie?”</p>

<p>“I do trust you,” said Frances miserably. “But I must
do what I think right. It would be a sin not to.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, don’t talk such nonsense. Do you mean
to say that you think we ought all to rush into convents, under
pain of sin? How would the world go on, pray?”</p>

<p>Bertha laughed a little, but Frances answered her quite
seriously.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think that. I quite see that everyone can’t
enter the religious life—but then everyone doesn’t want
to.”</p>

<p>“Every enthusiastic little girl who has just been bitten by
a Romanist craze wants to,” said Bertha laughing, “but no
one has any business to encourage them, and I don’t think
any the better of your convent authorities for doing so, my
Francie.”</p>

<p>“May I go there next month?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, you may not, and if you can’t make up
your mind to it, I shall forbid any more correspondence with
these people. I don’t want to be severe with you, and I
know quite well that you think you’re doing right and being
a little martyr in a sacred cause, etc., but I’ve got <i>my</i> conscience
to think of as well as yours, you know.”</p>

<p>Frances began to cry again, in a helpless, inefficient sort
of way that gave no hint of the sense of irrevocability that
had taken possession of her and finally clinched her resolution.</p>

<p>Bertha left the room, frowning a little in her vexation and
perplexity.</p>

<p>“You’re making yourself quite ill with all this worry, dear
Mrs. Tregaskis,” protested Minnie fondly. “You really
will break down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would take more than that to make me break
down, my dear! But it certainly is very tiresome, and making
the whole house uncomfortable. However, there’s a
meeting I have to go to at Pensevern school next week, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
I shall spend a couple of nights with Nina. That’ll make
a break, and give me a bit of a rest. And between ourselves,
Minnie, when I get back I’m going to arrange to send
Frances somewhere for a little change. It’ll do us all good
to get away from one another for a while, and then we shall
be able to start fresh. Poor little girl, I can’t bear to see
her so wretched.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Tregaskis,” said Minnie with conviction, “you
really are an angel without any wings.”</p>

<p>The following week witnessed the departure of the angelic
Mrs. Tregaskis for Pensevern, and the atmosphere
of tension at Porthlew sensibly relaxed.</p>

<p>Even Frances seemed to have recaptured some of the
characteristic serenity that she had only recently lost, and
she and Rosamund spent the afternoon together amongst
the mellow reds and yellows of the autumn garden, happy
in the midst of trivial, familiar things. As they turned
indoors as dusk was falling, Frances spoke.</p>

<p>“Rosamund, I had meant not to tell you—but after all,
I couldn’t—and besides, you always know.... You
know what Father Anselm said I ought to do——?”</p>

<p>A pang, that held far more of recognition in it than of
surprise, went through Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Go to the convent in spite of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m going to do it while Cousin Bertie is away.”</p>

<p>“Francie! Is it quite fair?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Frances calmly. “I haven’t told
Father Anselm or Mère Pauline or any of them, because it
would be such a dreadful responsibility for them to know—and,
besides, they might not think it right to <i>advise</i> me to
run away from home. But it’s the only way I shall ever
have the courage to do it.”</p>

<p>Rosamund felt a sense of utter impotence invading her
as she listened to the childish voice, made resolutely steady
and matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>“But Cousin Bertie will be back the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“I know. So I’m going to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Francie!”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said Frances, her voice quivering for the first
time. “It’s the only way I can ever do it, I’m such a moral
coward. And it’s far better to do it all quickly than to have
a long waiting first—that would be much harder for both
of us, Rosamund. At first I thought I wouldn’t even tell
you, so that you wouldn’t have to say good-bye or anything
sad—but then I couldn’t help it. I knew you’d understand.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Rosamund drearily, conscious only
that she must not make it harder for Frances. “But have
you thought at all how you’re going to do it?”</p>

<p>A sense of unreality rushed upon her.</p>

<p>“To-morrow! It’s impossible—you can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve looked up the trains and everything,” said Frances
literally. “I can take the one o’clock train, and you must
send my box after me. I can’t take it because the servants
would know—but by the time Cousin Bertie is back, everybody
will know, and it won’t matter.”</p>

<p>“You can’t arrive there with nothing at all,” said Rosamund,
her mind refusing to take in any but the immediate
practical issues of the case.</p>

<p>“I shall carry my little tiny attaché case, and if I start
early I’m certain to meet someone or other who will give
me a lift to the station. It’s market day, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’ve never even travelled alone,” began Rosamund
conscious of futility.</p>

<p>“But I can’t possibly make any mistake. It’s a through
train to London, and then I shall take a cab to Liverpool
Street Station and go on from there. It’s not a very long
journey if I get a good train.”</p>

<p>“Will they know you’re coming?”</p>

<p>“I shall telegraph from London.”</p>

<p>“Francie, you say you’re a moral coward, and yet you’ve
planned everything out like this! What would you do supposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
you met Cousin Bertie on your way to the station?
It might quite easily happen.”</p>

<p>Frances whitened instantly.</p>

<p>“I’d thought of that, but her meeting is at two o’clock,
and they’re sure to go early. Cousin Bertie always does.
So they’ll be having luncheon at one o’clock, and you know
Mrs. Severing hardly ever has the motor out in the mornings.
So I don’t think there’s any real chance of it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said Rosamund drearily. “What on
earth will she say when she comes back and finds you’ve
gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosamund, it will be so dreadful for you! I’ll
leave a letter for her, and then you won’t have to tell her.”</p>

<p>“What about Cousin Frederick and Miss Blandflower?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Frederick hardly ever comes in to luncheon, and
he’s quite likely not to notice that I’m not at dinner. Even
if he does, he’ll probably think I’ve just gone to bed or something—you
know he never bothers. I’m afraid Miss
Blandflower will have to know at dinner-time, but she won’t
be in herself for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“She’s going to the Rectory. She told me, quite by
chance. Oh, Rosamund,” said Frances with an awe-struck
face, “it does seem as though I were meant to do this.
All sorts of little things seem to have happened together, to
make it possible. You know Cousin Bertie never goes
away as a rule—I might have had to wait for months for
this opportunity, and yet it’s happened now—just the very
time that Mère Pauline wrote to say she would receive me
in the novitiate. It’s all too wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you’re really happy about it all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes! If only it wasn’t for the leaving of you.”</p>

<p>Rosamund marvelled miserably.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the evening went by in a dream.</p>

<p>She could not believe that it was Frances’ last night at
Porthlew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>But even if she came back, it would be only after an experience
that would stretch like a gulf between all that had
been before and all that might come after. She went to
Frances’ room and they packed her box, locking the bedroom
door carefully, and Rosamund wrote out a label and
affixed it to the small trunk.</p>

<p>“I’ll put the things in the attaché case to-morrow morning,”
said Frances, looking rather wistfully round the room.
“It seems so funny to be leaving all my frocks behind. I
wish you could wear them, Rosamund, but you’re too tall.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t leaving them for good. You’ll want them
when you come out,” cried Rosamund, and hurried on lest
Frances should contradict her: “You’ll remember that
you’ve promised—<i>promised</i>—to come away if you find
you’ve made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frances faithfully. “I’ll remember.”</p>

<p>That night they slept together.</p>

<p>The morning pierced through a soaking white mist, a
day typical of Cornwall in the autumn.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower came down looking harassed and haggard,
and announced that she had toothache. Breakfast
proceeded as usual, and Rosamund found it quite impossible
to realize that in a few hours Frances would be gone.</p>

<p>But the morning sped by, swift and yet leaden. At midday
Miss Blandflower put on galoshes and a mackintosh
and set off for the Rectory, valiantly suppressing a hinted
inclination to “give in” to her increasing toothache, and
remain seated over the fire, and as she went down the drive
Frances said gently:</p>

<p>“I shall want a waterproof. I’ve only got my blue serge
coat and skirt and my brown hat to travel in.”</p>

<p>“Put on thick shoes,” said Rosamund urgently, as though
she had no other preoccupation.</p>

<p>When Frances stood ready, looking pale and childish,
and grasping her little leather case, Rosamund pulled down
a thick Irish frieze cape from the hall and flung it round her
own shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“I’m coming as far as the road with you,” she said in an
inward voice.</p>

<p>Dumbly they went together down the steps and across
the gravelled court. The thick mist seemed to swallow them
up, and Frances put her hand into Rosamund’s.</p>

<p>Outside the drive gate they stopped. It was the high-road
which lay outside, and down which the farm carts and
pony traps would pass on their way to market.</p>

<p>“I will write to-night in the train, after I’ve left London.”</p>

<p>“So will I, darling.”</p>

<p>They stood in silence.</p>

<p>“If something doesn’t come soon, I ought to begin to
walk,” said Frances nervously. “I can’t miss the train.”</p>

<p>The sound of wheels, muffled in the fog but unmistakable,
came to them both almost as she spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if they’ll see us, the mist is so bad just
here. Come a little on to the road, Francie.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s Mrs. Westaway’s cart. I can see the white
horse.”</p>

<p>They hailed the cart and Frances called out her request.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife acceded to it cheerfully, begging Miss
Frances not to keep the mare standing, but to jump up
quickly.</p>

<p>So Rosamund kissed her once, almost threw the little case
in after her, and in another instant the high dog-cart and
jolly, fat Mrs. Westaway on the driving-seat with her great
baskets of market produce, and Frances clinging to the back
seat, and the impatient white mare, had all disappeared into
the mist, and even the sound of wheels had become inaudible.</p>

<p>She went back to the house, the laurels and rhododendron
bushes on either side of the drive dripping on to the
sodden ground.</p>

<p>All the afternoon she tried to tell herself that Frances
was gone, and found herself repeating the words over and
over again, but still they carried no conviction to her. She
thought that perhaps at dinner-time, when she would inevitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
have to explain Frances’ absence to Miss Blandflower,
it might help her to understand what had happened. But
Miss Blandflower sent a message downstairs to say that
her tooth was much worse, and she had gone to bed, and
did not wish to have any dinner.</p>

<p>So Rosamund and Frederick Tregaskis dined together in
almost unbroken silence, and he did not appear to notice the
absence of Frances. At nine o’clock a telegram was
brought to Rosamund, and she tore it open with a vague,
sick sense of apprehension, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Arrived safely—kindest possible welcome here—best
love.</i>—<span class="smcap">Francie.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>That night Rosamund cried and sobbed herself to sleep
as she had done in the days of her childhood after her
mother’s death.</p>

<p>She woke to the realization that Mrs. Tregaskis would return
that day.</p>

<p>At breakfast Frederick asked her suddenly:</p>

<p>“Is Frances upstairs?”</p>

<p>“No. Miss Blandflower is upstairs with toothache.”</p>

<p>“I know that. Where’s your sister?”</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at him dumbly, searching less for words
in which to clothe her meaning than for the power to speak
at all.</p>

<p>“H’m!” Frederick looked at her significantly. “You
can make your own explanations to your Cousin Bertha,
then.”</p>

<p>Rosamund instantly felt convinced that he knew perfectly
well what those explanations were to be.</p>

<p>Earlier than Rosamund had expected, she heard the hoot
of Mrs. Severing’s motor in the drive, and then sounds indicating
that Mrs. Tregaskis had descended and entered the
house.</p>

<p>Without the slightest idea of what she was about to do
or say, Rosamund went into the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>The mist of the day before had cleared altogether, and
sunlight streamed into the hall and over the ample form of
Mrs. Tregaskis, rapidly unwinding her motor-veil before the
glass, her back to the door against which Rosamund leant
heavily, from sheer physical inability to advance further.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower, a pallid and grotesque figure with one
side of her face swollen beneath the small grey shawl that
draped her head and shoulders, was hurrying feebly down
the stairs.</p>

<p>“My dear old Minnie! What <i>have</i> you been doing to
yourself? An abscess?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, nothing. A bad tooth, and I foolishly
went out in the wet yesterday and caught cold. There’s no
luck about the house—you know the old song, dear Mrs.
Tregaskis. It’s a sight for sore eyes to see you back, as
they say.”</p>

<p>“Where are my girls?”</p>

<p>Rosamund tried to speak, and made an inarticulate sound.</p>

<p>Bertha whirled round.</p>

<p>“Hallo, hallo! Why, my dear, what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Her voice changed.</p>

<p>“Rosamund, what’s happened? Where’s Frances?”</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower gazed from one to the other, a puzzled
smile further distorting her swollen face.</p>

<p>Quicker than Rosamund could find words Mrs. Tregaskis’
quick perceptions had leapt at the truth.</p>

<p>“Frances has gone? She’s gone to that convent?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosamund at last, and felt as though an immense
weight had suddenly been taken from her.</p>

<p>“Oh, she couldn’t have been so wicked—oh, I knew
<i>nothing</i> about it,” screamed Minnie, and collapsed on to the
stairs.</p>

<p>Bertha sank heavily on to a chair.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FRANCES gazed at her hands. Their appearance was
the greatest amongst the minor trials of convent life.
She wondered wistfully what Rosamund would
think of them. They were small hands, with long, nervous
fingers, and now each knuckle was swelled and purple from
the cold and unaccustomed manual work, and the chilblains
on the back of almost every one had broken and exposed
raw cracks and fissures to the chill morning air.</p>

<p>The novice with her serge habit tucked up so as to expose
the stout black underskirt below, the coarse cotton stockings
and heavy, ill-made shoes, bore small resemblance to Frances
Grantham in her blue coat and skirt and brown velvet hat,
arriving at the convent door some few months before.</p>

<p>Her face was fuller, and had more colour in it, but there
was a deep black shadow under each eye denoting lack of
sufficient sleep.</p>

<p>This question of sleep had assumed for Frances, as for
her companions, a prominence that seemed strange and unnatural.</p>

<p>Hitherto Frances had slept for eight hours every night,
sometimes for longer, and had never thought of the amount
of rest she took in any but the most cursory and matter-of-fact
fashion. In the first days of her convent life, the
novice-mistress spoke to her of the early rising as a trial
which might perhaps prove severe. Frances thought:
“Getting up at five in cold weather must be an effort, until
one gets used to it.”</p>

<p>She heard the bell clang out its one hundred strokes every
morning, at the first stroke of which the novice in the cubicle
on either side of her sprang from her straw mattress to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
thin strip of carpet that lay beside each bed. For the first
six weeks she had fallen asleep again instantly, and only
been roused by the small alarm clock set for six o’clock
which her novice-mistress had made her use. Then she
asked for permission to rise with the others and follow the
full routine of the day, and it was granted her. The first
stroke of the “cloche à cent coups” was now the signal for
her also to leave her pallet and begin the day with the ritual
of mental prayer prescribed for each religious during her
robing. Heavy and sodden with sleep though her eyelids
felt, Frances found that the mere physical anticipation of
the inexorable clang that heralded five o’clock, would very
often wake her even earlier, and keep her awake, tense and
nervous with the fear that she might lack courage enough
to rise on the very instant that the first sound of the bell
should clash into the air.</p>

<p>But she always found that the physical effort, in some
mysterious way, was overcome, and that accomplished,
she lost the sense of mental stress, and was only conscious
of the overpowering need of sleep. Through the winter
months, when even a liberal application of ice-cold water
failed to rouse her more than momentarily, she seldom
knew by what mechanical process she had dressed, and
found her way down the dark stone corridor and steep stairway
only lighted by a flickering little oil-lamp, until she was
on her knees in the as-yet-unwarmed chapel, waiting for
the stroke of half-past five to proclaim the hour for meditation.</p>

<p>Kneeling upright upon the boards, her hands clasped upon
the back of a <i>prie-dieu</i> too high to support her elbows, the
struggle with her atrophied senses gradually began. Conscious
effort was succeeded by the spasmodic violent starts
that proclaimed her will to be alive, and gaining dominion
over her relaxed muscles.</p>

<p>From the stall where the novice-mistress knelt, invariably
upright, her wide-open gaze fixed upon the High Altar,
came the slow unemphatic announcements of the Points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
of Meditation, cutting across the cold, still atmosphere of
the chapel.</p>

<p>Frances forced her mind to receive the words, then gradually
to attach to them a meaning. After that, in spite of
cold and the cramp that almost invariably seized her from
the effort to remain motionless upon her knees, her mind
was awake, and her battle with sleep was over until the evening.
Through the recital of the Office, and the early Mass,
attention was seldom an effort to Frances. Afterwards,
the rapid, efficient sweeping and dusting of her cubicle and
the struggle to turn the heavy <i>paillasse</i> on the wooden planks
which formed the bed, left her heated and glowing, only
anxious lest she should be late in taking her place in the
long refectory for breakfast.</p>

<p>Instructions and religious exercises filled the morning,
and the midday recreation succeeded dinner.</p>

<p>“The test of a good novice is her attitude towards the
community recreation,” was a favourite axiom of the novice-mistress.</p>

<p>Frances had been told that this recreation might prove to
be a great trial, and sometimes wondered whether there was
anything abnormal in her extreme and childlike enjoyment
of this part of her religious life.</p>

<p>The ten or twelve novices, most of whom were Irish or
English, one American, two Spanish and the rest French,
spent the allotted forty-five minutes in company of the
novice-mistress, and of one another. The conversation was
general, usually gay, and always impersonal.</p>

<p>Up and down the small garden the little group paced
slowly on fine days, carefully avoiding the larger gathering
of “la grande communautée,” also assembled in recreation
round the Superior. Little or no intercourse was permitted
between the novices and the professed religious.</p>

<p>On wet days, and not infrequently on days which
Frances regretfully thought delightfully fresh and moist,
but at which the novice-mistress raised protesting hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
exclamations of “Ce climat anglais!” the perambulations
of the novitiate took place in a long corridor some six or
seven feet broad, the length of which it was possible to
traverse slowly, in little groups of three or four, always with
the novice-mistress as central point. Many of the novices
walked backwards, so as to face her continually. Most of
them held knitting, or wool which could be wound on to
cards whilst still walking, but as soon as she made a move
into the small community room, mending and darning
baskets were produced and set upon the floor beside each
low wooden stool ranged against the wall. The novice-mistress
sat also upon a stool, placed on a low, wooden dais
at the end of the room. She thus dominated the room as
naturally as she did the conversation. In her early days
at the convent it was a continual cause of wonder to Frances
that this conversation, general as it was, could remain so
animated and yet so singularly impersonal.</p>

<p>The welfare of the Order in general was often discussed,
the old days when its headquarters had been in Paris tenderly
recalled by the novice-mistress, and her varied
reminiscences of those times and of the expulsion which
ensued, eagerly listened to by the little assembly. Sometimes
there was talk of such small technicalities as the origin
of some point of Rubric, or a broader question of Church
ruling, but for the most part the conversation ran cheerfully
upon trivial lines. It was always conducted in French, and
the famous Gallicanism—“Moi, je”—was apt to provoke
a general burst of merry laughter and a humorous glance
or word of rebuke from the novice-mistress. But pronouns
relating to the first person singular were seldom much in
evidence.</p>

<p>The knowledge that she must not seek to place herself
beside any one companion, that she must not move from her
low stool during recreation without asking and obtaining
leave to do so, and that any form of personality beyond the
most trivial allusion must be excluded from her conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
failed to disturb Frances’ calm enjoyment of the three-quarters
of an hour which always seemed to her so quickly
over.</p>

<p>Rising from her little stool on the first stroke of the bell
which proclaimed renewed silence, she was generally conscious
of distinct exhilaration, resulting from the interval
of talk and laughter. In virtue of her English nationality,
Frances was often allowed to make her half-hour’s spiritual
reading out of doors. This she did after the midday recreation,
gravely kilting her serge habit above the stiff woollen
underskirt, and pacing the round of the garden with steady,
measured footsteps, her head bent over some devotional
volume bound in stout brown paper with a little gummed
blue label on the back.</p>

<p>The afternoon’s routine of instructions, choir-practices,
and the like was unbroken till supper at seven o’clock. The
institution of afternoon tea held no place in the convent curriculum,
and Frances, who had been told that this might at
first present itself to her in the light of a deprivation, found
herself, on the contrary, thankful that no additional meal
should intervene between the substantial dinner and supper.</p>

<p>The amount of coarse but nourishing food which she
found herself expected to assimilate was a continual source
of wonder and at first of distress, to the novice. Where
were the ascetic fasts and austerities of the religious life, if
one was required to make two such meals every day? Even
on the regular days of fasting and abstinence decreed by the
Church, Frances found that she was only allowed to indulge
in a modified form of abstention.</p>

<p>Even after six months’ novitiate, she still looked doubtfully
at the brown platter heaped with butter beans, the
hunk of bread, and the huge slab of cold meat that so often
constituted her midday portion. She knew that she might
not leave anything unfinished, and the half-hour allotted to
dinner was apt to hurry past her and bring her to her feet
at the recital of Grace with half of her allowance still untouched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“<i>Ma mère, puis-je aller finir au réfectoire?</i>” was the
formula which was oftenest on her lips in those early days.
And on the permission being given, Frances would valiantly
return to the attack.</p>

<p>Supper presented fewer difficulties. A religious or biographical
work was read aloud, and whilst giving her full
attention to that, Frances found it easier to dispose of the
pudding-basin full of soup and the mighty wedge of pudding
or the vegetable stew which might form the repast.</p>

<p>But the ethics of the case still troubled her.</p>

<p>Finally she brought her difficulty to Mère Thérèse.</p>

<p>“You must eat in order to work, my child. Remember
that you have entered an order where there is much manual
labour to be done, and also the instruction of our poor
people, our <i>dames pensionnaires</i> to attend to. Had you
entered an order where physical austerity is the first object,
then indeed you would not complain of having too much.</p>

<p>“But tell me, my little Sister, is it not a greater hardship
to you to follow the holy rule of obedience and eat all that is
set before you, than it would be to deprive yourself of all
but the bare necessities?”</p>

<p>She laughed shrewdly at Frances’ conscious expression,
and indeed no argument could have prevailed more strongly
with the little novice. She learnt to look upon the completion
of her meals as a task to be performed conscientiously,
and felt a glow of triumph when she was able to
wash the wooden fork and spoon and the blunt knife in her
little pewter bowl of water, and place them in due order
upon the table before the signal for rising was given.</p>

<p>The evening recreation which succeeded supper was a
repetition of the morning one, and did not terminate until
the clanging bell at eight o’clock proclaimed that the convent
world had entered into “<i>le grand silence</i>,” which
would remain unbroken save for the most urgent necessity,
until after Mass the following morning.</p>

<p>Collecting the manuals containing the office for the day
from her tiny pigeon-hole, Frances would join the noiseless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
softly hurrying throng of novices and descend to the
chapel. On her knees at the high <i>prie-dieu</i>, which she
would presently leave for a carved stall when the general
recital of the office began, she embarked nightly upon the
hardest struggle of her present existence—that against an
overpowering need of sleep. Again and again Frances
fell asleep while kneeling, only to wake instantly with a violent
start, and force her eyelids, heavy as lead, to remain
open over her filmed, unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>The novice in the stall next her, a Spanish child not yet
nineteen, slumbered uneasily as unwillingly every night
through the recital of Matins and Lauds, and one of
Frances’ most effective devices for keeping herself awake
was that of gently pushing her neighbour into position when
the nuns rose for the <i>Gloria Patri</i> that concluded every
psalm.</p>

<p>She half envied little Sister Encarnaçion that uncomfortable
three-quarters of an hour’s sleep. For her own
part, Frances never quite lost consciousness, although the
curious intermittent buzzing in her head often prevented her
from hearing her own voice joining in the psalms and
hymns. But it was always with intense, though most involuntary,
thankfulness, that she sank on to her knees for the
last time, for the two or three moments silent devotion that
preceded the final signal at which the novices rose and filed
slowly, two by two, from the chapel. It was then generally
some few minutes before half-past nine, but if the big clock
on the stairs, which she passed every night, its ticking loud
and portentous in the absolute silence, showed the hour to
be even a very little later than usual, Frances was conscious
of a purely physical sensation of sick dismay and resentment
at the abridgement of her night.</p>

<p>In her cubicle she undressed as rapidly and silently as
possible, and fell asleep almost as she lay down on her
<i>paillasse</i>. To its iron hardness and the absence of any support
but the smallest and stiffest of bolsters, she had never
given a thought, since the first week when her arms and sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
for a little while had shown the faint discoloration of
bruises.</p>

<p>The days, regular and incessantly occupied, flew by with
a rapidity that she had never known before, and it was
always with a sort of shock of surprise that Frances greeted
the arrival of each Saturday morning, the day which was
marked for her by the unfailing arrival of Rosamund’s
weekly letter.</p>

<p>She had long ago, with tears, asked her sister to conform
to the convent regulation, which did not extend its approval
to more than one weekly letter from home for its novices,
although no definite commands were issued except in the
matter of the letters sent out. These might not exceed
one every Sunday to a parent or guardian, and one a fortnight
to a sister or brother. Frances, however, was permitted
to reverse the custom, and it was to Rosamund that
her Sunday letter was always addressed.</p>

<p>One of the strangest and hardest pangs that her torn and
divided loyalty was to suffer, lay in the knowledge that no
restriction was placed upon the correspondence of a nun or
novice and any other member of the Order, domiciled in
“one of our houses abroad.”</p>

<p>That this tie, strong and sacred although she believed it to
be, should be held closer than that of blood, remained to
Frances an incomprehensible and rather heartrending convention
of which she shunned the thought as a temptation
to disloyalty.</p>

<p>Her sense of proportion, like that of all those who lead
the cloistered life altered strangely and rapidly.</p>

<p>Her letters to Rosamund, the aching dread lest the new
life should separate her irrevocably from Rosamund, the
little tender recollections of their life together, of Lady
Argent’s kindness, of Hazel and her two babies, that had
thronged her mind at first, had given place imperceptibly but
with the strangest rapidity, to other preoccupations and
other aspirations.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the things which mattered most were naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
those which filled the atmosphere into which she found herself
transplanted.</p>

<p>The field of her external interests was naturally an extremely
narrow one. The novice-mistress, the small society
of her fellow-novices, and an occasional one or two of the
older nuns, were the only human beings with whom she
ever came into contact, and this intercourse, extremely limited
as it was, took place either in one of the few rooms
where speech was permitted, or in the narrow confines of the
convent garden. It was as brief as possible, and was always,
except when receiving direct spiritual guidance from
Mère Thérèse, as impersonal as the sense of discipline on
either part could make it.</p>

<p>Her small duties, for the faithful accomplishment of
which she would receive no commendation, loomed enormous
to Frances. She took a joyful pride in the thorough
sweeping of the only long corridor which the house contained,
and which had been given into her charge, and she
looked forward anxiously to her bi-weekly mornings in the
kitchen, where the lay-sisters laughed furtively and good-naturedly
at her utter ignorance of those primary laws of
<i>le ménage</i> which never seemed to present any difficulties to
her French and Spanish contemporaries. On two evenings
a week she taught in an elementary class of the poor school
attached to the convent, and was gradually learning not to
tremble at the apprehension that the six or seven-year-old
urchins would decline to be instructed in the multiplication
table by anyone so young and so frightened.</p>

<p>The novices, as a rule, were never sent amongst the lady
boarders, but when she had been at the convent some four
months, Frances was told that she was to work regularly
under the Mère Econome. She thus found herself deputed
occasionally to take an interview on behalf of the much-occupied
Mère Caroline, so that she was not without fugitive
intercourse with those whom she had soon learned to
designate, in all due charity and perfectly unconscious arrogance,
as “<i>les personnes du dehors</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>During these brief interviews the little novice was always
highly conscious of the gulf which should lie between the
manners of ordinary social intercourse and the demeanour
of a young religious obliged through obedience to hold a
needful conversation with an inhabitant of the outer world.</p>

<p>She was careful to say the prescribed <i>Ave Maria</i> to herself
on the threshold of the small parlour where these conversations
took place, and would enter holding herself unconsciously
more upright than usual, her eyes downcast, and
her hands tucked away under her wide sleeves. It had frequently
been impressed upon her that a religious “<i>ne
s’affaise pas sur sa chaise comme si elle avait l’habitude des
fauteuils</i>,” and consequently she sat on the extreme edge of
her chair, very much erect, and with her feet carefully concealed
beneath the ample folds of her habit.</p>

<p>The business in hand she disposed of as rapidly as the extreme
eloquence with which most of the lady boarders were
afflicted, permitted.</p>

<p>It was no temptation to Frances to prolong the conversations
in the parlour. She was naturally shy, and had, all her
life, more or less unconsciously, preferred silence to speech.</p>

<p>She also became aware, as must all those who pursue a
way of spiritual endeavour, that silence is the preliminary
to concentration.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the convent, which Frances had heard
spoken of outside its walls as “peaceful” and “gentle” was,
to her awakened perceptions, mainly one of intense concentration.
The whole place, silent and monotonous, and even
trivial in detail, was instinct with a force that seemed to
vibrate through the stillness. Frances could discern this
force in the chapel, in the refectory, most of all perhaps in
the cold, narrow dormitory. The words which came oftenest
to her mind were the “<i>Ego dormio: et cor meum vigilat</i>,”
painted in red letters a foot high on the whitewashed
wall just above the narrow window.</p>

<p>She could not have spoken of this impression of tense
unceasing life which for her lay behind all the convent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
routine, but she felt a new sensation as of being mentally
at rest, as though she were at last able to share and recognize
the scale of relative values prevailing in her surroundings.</p>

<p>Of the progress of her spiritual life she was scarcely
aware. Frances was not introspective, and possessed that
curious detachment from herself sometimes observable in
extremely and fundamentally innocent personalities.</p>

<p>She listened to the instructions given, both general and
particular, with the careful attention of a conscientious
child, noted her failures to observe good resolutions in a
tiny paper notebook kept in her pocket, and made it a
matter of habit to observe scrupulously the more minute
details of her daily duties.</p>

<p>She was naturally careful, and had been taught order by
Mrs. Tregaskis, but her tendency to sit and dream was a
source of much heart-searching to Frances.</p>

<p>“Vous êtes dans la lune, ma petite sœur,” was a brisk reminder
often uttered by Mère Thérèse, and Frances would
return to earth with a guilty start and a few words of fervent
contrition and resolution in her heart.</p>

<p>When the winter was drawing to a close, and Frances
had been at the Convent nearly six months, Mère Thérèse
spoke to her of her <i>prise d’habit</i>. The ceremony, goal of
every novice’s thoughts, was the first stage of the religious
life proper. The novice exchanged her own name for a
religious one bestowed upon her by the Superior, her hair
was cut off, and the white Cross of her Order fastened upon
the front of her habit. It was the preliminary step to the
vows which she would take later on.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma Mère!” stammered Frances, her face one flush
of joy.</p>

<p>“I think so, little one. I have spoken to Notre Mère
Supérieure, and the ceremony will probably be for Easter
Monday ... you must be very, very fervent....”</p>

<p>Frances lay awake till dawn, heavy with sleep, yet too
much excited to sleep, and thanking God with all the fervour
of her innocent heart.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MA MÈRE, may one ask if any of Sister Frances’
family are coming for the ceremony to-morrow?”
inquired the American novice at the
evening recreation on Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>“Her sister is coming for the day, and perhaps a friend.
The poor child has no parents.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is as well,” said a little French novice
calmly. “It is such a sacrifice for the parents, however
pious, and the thought of their grief must be a distraction.”</p>

<p>Her neighbour, a placid Spanish girl, looked surprised.
In Andalusia the parents of the Lola or Pepita who had “la
vocacion” would let her go with pride and joy, although
they could not, like these rich Americans, hope to see her for
the yearly visit permitted by the regulations, when, as would
probably happen at the end of her novitiate, she should be
sent away to some house of the Order overseas. She herself
had only left home some few months ago, but even her
little sister Conchita, who was only ten, had been too glad of
the great honour and joy of seeing Maria a nun, to cry at
losing her. But she kept her thoughts to herself and remained
silent.</p>

<p>The American novice, with a sudden recollection that hurt
like a physical pang, of a lonely, bewildered old couple in
New England, as unrelenting, as uncomprehending in their
condemnation of their only daughter’s lapse into an alien
and idolatrous creed, quickly changed the conversation by
asking another question of Mère Thérèse.</p>

<p>“What name is she to receive, ma Mère?”</p>

<p>“Supposing you try to guess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>The novice-mistress looked cheerfully at one smiling face
after another, as the novices vied with one another in childish
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Sœur Aimé, ma Mère! We have no one of that name.”</p>

<p>“‘Innocente’ would suit her, I think,” said the American.</p>

<p>“Is it a double name, ma Mère?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then one of them is Mary!”</p>

<p>Mère Thérèse nodded.</p>

<p>“Mary Emmanuel!”</p>

<p>“Elizabeth Mary.”</p>

<p>The old nun shook her head, still laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“Lolita Maria,” exclaimed the little Spanish novice of
eighteen who was Frances’ neighbour in the chapel, selecting
the names she thought the prettiest.</p>

<p>There was a fresh burst of merriment.</p>

<p>“<i>Pour une novice anglaise, ah, par example!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Voilà bien Sœur Encarnaçion! une de ses idées à elle.
Une religieuse qui s’appelerait Lolita! Ce serait gentil!</i>”</p>

<p>Sœur Encarnaçion looked self-conscious, and the novice-mistress
said at once:</p>

<p>“Come, my children, you are not very wide awake. We
have only five minutes more—I see that I must help you.
What do we call our little <i>retraitante</i> at present?”</p>

<p>“Sister Frances!”</p>

<p>“She is keeping her own name, then?”</p>

<p>“Could she have a better one? St. Francis of Assisi—dear
St. Francis of Sales—what a collection of patrons to
choose from.”</p>

<p>“Is it Frances Mary or Mary Frances, ma Mère?” inquired
the American, whose baptismal names were Belinda
Oriane, and upon whom had been bestowed the appellation
of Sister Perpetua.</p>

<p>“Frances Mary,” replied the novice-mistress, rising from
her seat, at which signal work was instantly folded into
baskets and silence resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>Frances was making the five days’ Retreat which preceded
the ceremony of her <i>prise d’habit</i>.</p>

<p>She was serenely happy.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in her mind with regard to the step
which she was about to take. It was merely a longed-for
milestone on the road to the attainment of her heart’s desire.
Although more conscious than ever before, during
these few days’ pause in the activity of her daily life, of an
intense physical fatigue, she felt strangely uplifted in spirit,
and as though newly inspired with a spiritual energy which
might overcome that rock in the way of salvation, her physical
frailty.</p>

<p>Strangely mingled with her exaltation of mind, was a
trivial, childish feeling of dread lest Rosamund might find
her altered. She assured herself in vain that she had not
changed in any way that could strike her sister with a sense
of alteration. But she knew that her whole perspective had
changed, and that what was to her the reality of life would
seem no more to Rosamund than a mysterious, and rather
futile, phase.</p>

<p>She found herself wondering, wistfully and rather nervously,
what the regulations would be as to conduct in the
parlour.</p>

<p>That her interview with Rosamund, brief though it was
to be, would be fraught with these, Frances could not doubt.
In letters to her sister, she had again and again to consider
the injunctions laid upon every nun or novice of the Order.
Terms of excessive endearment, exaggerated expressions of
affection or solicitude, were alike unbecoming to a religious,
and of all the many details of her daily life that Rosamund
longed to know and Frances to impart, only a very few, and
those of the least personal character, did not come under
the ban of convent secrecy. The letters were always signed
by the writer’s full “name in religion.”</p>

<p>Frances, during the hour allotted to letter-writing on Sundays,
had often seen her American neighbour, in the unavoidable
proximity of the small, closely-ranged desks, crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
silently over those difficult letters, which in her case
were never answered. Frances surmised involuntarily that
the changed handwriting, forced to conform to a sloping,
pointed, French model, the stilted phraseology which was
the inevitable outcome of that enforced reserve, the strange
signature, with its orthodox preface, “Your loving child in
Christ,” were so many additional pangs to those who understood
no conventual shibboleths and resented with a resentment
that was the more bitter for its utter lack of comprehension,
being robbed of child or sister.</p>

<p>Rosamund would understand, Frances had told herself
passionately, inditing those first strange little letters, that
made her heart ache for the disappointment they must carry
with them. And that Rosamund <i>had</i> understood she knew
from her replies, guarded and restrained enough, but breathing
no hint of doubt or perplexity.</p>

<p>All letters to or from the members of the novitiate were,
of course, examined by the novice-mistress, as were those of
the professed nuns by the Superior. Nor was this censorship
a nominal one. Mère Thérèse understood Spanish as
well as French, and had a fair knowledge of English, but
twice already Frances had been told to translate various unintelligible
portions of her correspondence. Once, only a
few weeks ago, she had heard the calm habitual silence of
the little room where the novices’ desks were ranged against
the wall violently broken by the noise of sudden uncontrollable
sobbing. Frances blamed herself that she had not had
the presence of mind to keep that custody of the eyes enjoined
by every precept and practice of the religious life, but
she had raised her head quickly and instinctively, and had
seen Sœur Marie-Edmée crying hysterically over the torn
pieces of a letter lying on her desk.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to guess that her letter to the anxious,
waiting mother or little sister in the South of France had
been found unsuitably restrained or full of indiscreet detail,
and would not be sent that week.</p>

<p>But Sœur Marie-Edmée was from Marseilles, impulsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
and emotional, and very soon afterwards she had disappeared
from the novitiate.</p>

<p>The novices were told, as was customary in such cases,
that her health was not equal to the strain of the religious
life.</p>

<p>Frances thought again how terrible a breakdown of health
which should necessitate leaving the convent would be. She
was sincerely convinced that to one who had tried the cloistered
life, existence “in the world” must be unendurable.</p>

<p>She remembered how often Mère Thérèse had said
briskly: “Où Dieu donne la vocation, il donne la santé,”
and reflected with perfect simplicity that it would really only
be necessary for her health to hold out until after her final
vows, which she hoped to take in three years’ time. She
knew that many of the older professed nuns suffered almost
permanently from disease, mostly of the digestive system,
and almost all had to endure the nightly torture of senses
atrophied and nerves strained by the want of sufficient sleep,
but very few of them ever broke down, even for a day or
two.</p>

<p>After all, thought Frances, what did it matter once the
earthly goal attained? One entered the religious life in
order to give oneself to God. Should He not take toll of
the life dedicated to Him as best He pleased?</p>

<p>She waited for this first ceremony which should mark her
entrance into the road of self-immolation with no shadow
of apprehension.</p>

<p>Easter Monday dawned clear and cloudless.</p>

<p>Immediately after the first Mass, Frances was summoned
to Mère Thérèse’s room and told that the ceremony was to
take place at midday.</p>

<p>“Your sister will arrive, with Lady Argent, very soon
after ten, so you must go to them in the parlour for a few
moments,” she said considerately. “Then, of course, after
the ceremony, you can return to them again.”</p>

<p>Frances, far more overwrought than she knew, found it
impossible to command her thoughts that morning. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
went about her work with her mind in a tumult, often referring
to the tiny notebook in her pocket, in which she had
written down various things that she wanted to say to Rosamund.
When Advent came, and Lent, now that she was
really a novice, Frances would not be able to write or receive
any letters during these seasons, so Rosamund must not expect
to hear from her. Rosamund was to ask to see Mère
Thérèse, and be very, very nice to her, because Mère
Thérèse had been so good to Frances. Would Rosamund
send some fern-roots from Porthlew as soon as she got
back? They would be so nice in the garden, where no
flowers would ever grow. Frances was allowed an extra
half-hour in the garden almost every day, because she was
used to fresh air. It would please Rosamund to hear that.</p>

<p>Then Frances heard the sound of a motor in the street
below. She might not look out of the window, but her heart
beat violently, and she could not but strain her ears for the
sound of the front-door bell.</p>

<p>It came.</p>

<p>She wondered whether she ought to go on sweeping the
corridor, and if the lay-sister in charge of the parlour would
know where to find her. But when old Sister Louise finally
creaked slowly upstairs, she only smiled and nodded at the
little novice with her long-handled broom, and went to
knock at Mère Thérèse’s door.</p>

<p>Frances heard “Entrez!” and then through the open door
the clear incisive accents of her novice-mistress.</p>

<p>“Un petit moment, ma sœur! Je vous appellerai tout-de-suite.”</p>

<p>Evidently she was engaged in the direction of one of her
flock.</p>

<p>Old Sister Louise retired submissively, closing the door
again. She leant her tired old body against the wall, and
then suddenly straightened it again with an effort and stood
wearily, her weight leaning on one foot, fingering the brown
rosary that hung from her girdle and slowly praying with
moving lips and closed eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>Frances finished the last few yards of corridor.</p>

<p>“Sœur Louise!” came from the novice-mistress’s room.</p>

<p>This time Sister Louise shut the door behind her as she
went in to deliver the message.</p>

<p>Frances, her heart beating violently and a mist before her
eyes, went and put her broom away in its accustomed corner.</p>

<p>She dawdled unconsciously, to delay the moment when
she must return to the more remote community room belonging
to the novitiate. Then the door of Mère Thérèse’s
room opened, and Frances heard her say:</p>

<p>“Très bien, très bien. Cherchez-moi cette petite.”</p>

<p>“Elle est là, Mère Thérèse.”</p>

<p>Frances came forward quickly.</p>

<p>“You are needed in the parlour,” said her novice-mistress
smiling. “Go with Sister Louise, my child.”</p>

<p>Frances turned, still blindly, to follow the old lay-sister.</p>

<p>“Your apron—your sleeves,” muttered Sister Louise in
a scandalized whisper.</p>

<p>With fingers that shook, Frances took off the black apron
and sleeves that protected her habit. She folded them and
laid them in the accustomed pigeon-hole.</p>

<p>How slowly Sister Louise creaked downstairs! With
what deliberation she turned, in the hall, to make mysterious
signs that should not infringe the rule of silence, and should
yet convey a communication.</p>

<p>Frances gazed at her in an agony. What further delay
was this?</p>

<p>Suddenly she understood that her habit was still tucked
up over her petticoat as it had been while she swept the
corridor.</p>

<p>She caught at the folds round her waist and pulled
them down, her hands shaking uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Sœur Louise’s hand was actually on the parlour-door
now.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned to the novice and whispered
huskily:</p>

<p>“<i>N’oubliez pas votre Ave Maria.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Frances stared at her for an instant and then put her
hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>She never knew what it was that she said.</p>

<p>The next moment the door was open and she was in the
parlour, with Rosamund.</p>

<p>Neither of them knew how long that first eager clasp endured,
neither was in the least conscious of the presence of
Lady Argent, gazing, already tearful, out of the window.</p>

<p>When at last she turned from her lengthy contemplation,
Frances was seated, flushed and trembling a little, but
sedate in her ample white habit, and Rosamund was kneeling
on the floor beside her, their hands tightly locked together.</p>

<p>It always struck Frances afterwards with a curious sense
of incongruity that her first words, after that prolonged
gaze, should have been uttered in a strangely shaking little
voice:</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosamund, you’ve got on new clothes that I’ve
never seen before!”</p>

<p>It was the odd, trivial expression of the enormous interval
that lay between their life together and the new evolution
of Frances.</p>

<p>Then Lady Argent kissed them both and said:</p>

<p>“My dearest child, you look just exactly the same, and
yet so utterly different, and the habit and everything—so
absolutely natural to see you in it, and so very strange, dear—you
know what I mean. I never was so glad of anything
in my life, only, of course, one knows there is no joy without
sacrifice, and, my dear, you really look better than I’ve ever
seen you. Are you quite well?”</p>

<p>“Are you happy?” asked Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Frances replied fervently to both questions.
“I’m <i>so</i> happy—it’s everything I ever thought it would be—only
better. And I’m very, very well. I haven’t seen
myself in a looking-glass, but they all say I’m fatter than
when I came.”</p>

<p>“So you are,” said Rosamund doubtfully. “Your face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
is much rounder, but you’re very black under your eyes,
darling.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” replied Frances laughing a little, and instinctively
putting up her hand to the tell-tale eyes.</p>

<p>Lady Argent fumbled in her satin bag.</p>

<p>“My dear, if it isn’t absolutely against the rule, and I
don’t think it can be, would you like to see yourself in my
little tiny hand-mirror? To think you’ve never seen yourself
in the glass since you came here! And really the habit
is so very becoming, though how you ever get your veil
straight without a glass—not that a little one this size
would be any use, only my maid and Ludovic always insist
on my carrying it about with me because of my hat, you
know. To keep it straight,” Lady Argent explained with a
gentle push which drove her black toque over her left ear.</p>

<p>Frances laid the little mirror gently on her lap without
looking into it. She did not know if the use of a looking-glass
was for ever forbidden to a nun, but she felt no desire
to risk a transgression of the rule.</p>

<p>“How long can you stay with us?” asked Rosamund
wistfully.</p>

<p>Frances started painfully—she had forgotten to inquire.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she faltered. “You see, the <i>prise d’habit</i>
is at twelve, and it’s nearly eleven now. They will want
me to go and get ready.” She gazed at Rosamund, wondering
if her sister would think her more occupied with the
observance of convent etiquette than with their meeting.
That no such lack of comprehension was Rosamund’s was
evident in her reassuring, “Of course, darling. Do you
think you ought to go and find out when they’ll want you?”</p>

<p>Only the look in her eyes spoke the effort of sacrificing
any of those few precious moments together, and Frances’
heart went out to her in passionate gratitude.</p>

<p>“Why can’t I ask to see Mother Theresa?” inquired
Lady Argent. “I should like to see her, and then you can
talk to Rosamund, dear, and we can find out all about how
much time you can give us—but, of course, as it’s only one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
day like this, they’re sure to send you for the whole time—so
much more satisfactory, I always think, than half-an-hour
here and there and then rushing away because some dreadful
little bell has rung and leaving one to look for hours at
those very uninteresting photographs of Rome and places,
in enormous albums. You know the sort of thing, my dear;
I can see two of them on that big table over there. Don’t
move, either of you. I’m going to find the portress and ask
for Mother Theresa.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent left them.</p>

<p>It seemed to Frances only a few moments later that she
reappeared, and Mère Thérèse was with her.</p>

<p>The novice rose to her feet.</p>

<p>After a very little conversation, Mère Thérèse looked
towards Frances, who said instantly:</p>

<p>“Is it time for me to go, ma Mère?”</p>

<p>“I fear so, my child. You know that there is a grand
<i>toilette</i> to be made to-day. But you will return to <i>ces dames</i>
at once after the ceremony, and remain until they go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” breathed Rosamund, gazing at her
sister.</p>

<p>Mère Thérèse looked at the two faces, so singularly alike
in colouring and outline. “<i>C’est gentil</i>,” she said gently to
Lady Argent, “<i>deux sœurs qui s’aiment si bien</i>.”</p>

<p>Then Frances went quietly out of the parlour and upstairs
again.</p>

<p>She was aware that tears were very near her eyes, and
that she understood why some of the novices had said:
“<i>Ah! les familles, un jour de prise d’habit</i>——” and had
left the sentence unfinished except for an ominous shake of
the head.</p>

<p>But she was also deeply and ardently thankful.</p>

<p>Nothing was changed between her and Rosamund. She
thought with compassionate amazement of a <i>prise d’habit</i>
she had seen during her first week in the novitiate, when the
novices had been asked to pray especially for their companion
because her father and mother, non-Catholic, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
refused to come to the ceremony or to send any token of
forgiveness to the daughter who had taken her own way at
the bidding of her conscience, and in defiance of her parents.</p>

<p>Even Cousin Bertie had written a very kind letter which
Frances had received that morning, bidding God bless her
in the way that she had chosen, and only asking her to remember
that there was always a home waiting for her at
Porthlew, and a welcome when, or if ever, she should come
back there.</p>

<p>Hazel had written too, a very affectionate letter, and
asked if she might send Frances anything for a present,
whatever would be nicest and most useful, and would
Frances always remember that good people were needed in
the world dreadfully badly, and if she ever came out of the
convent, and wanted somewhere to go to, she must come
straight to Hazel, who would always love to have her.</p>

<p>They all wrote of her leaving the convent! Only Rosamund,
the novice reflected, never said, or seemed to think,
that Frances had mistaken her vocation.</p>

<p>Kneeling for an instant at the little shrine that stood
outside the door of the dormitory, Frances thanked God for
Rosamund, and prayed fervently that the step she was about
to take that day might be blessed for them both.</p>

<p>“And some day—together again,” she ended on a stifled
sob.</p>

<p>Then she went quietly into the dormitory.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FRANCES could not help feeling that it was as well
that her Retreat had officially ended that morning
after the first Mass, for no further opportunity was
vouchsafed her for reflection.</p>

<p>A French lay-sister, to whom the office was always entrusted,
came to dress her in the wedding-dress of cheap
white satin, convent-made, and long white lace veil.</p>

<p>She found the little novice with all her soft straight
brown hair hanging over her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Sœur Eugénie, “au moins vous serez quitte
de tout cela demain!” She picked up a strand of the long
silken mass and let it fall again disdainfully.</p>

<p>“What a joy, to have finished with one’s <i>coiffure</i> for
ever!” she remarked complacently. Then she produced
hairpins which had served in the same capacity many times
before, and twisted the novice’s hair into a species of strange
outstanding chignon which had been fashionable some forty
years previously in Paris.</p>

<p>“Vous voila!” she said triumphantly, when Frances had
suffered under her vigorous ministrations for what seemed
a long while.</p>

<p>She produced a small, very old, folding mirror, and
Frances gazed in silence at the monstrous erection. She
was more distressed on Rosamund’s account than on her
own, and tried surreptitiously to pull and coax the strained-back
hair over her forehead and temples.</p>

<p>When the dress and veil were fastened she looked at herself
in the glass again and saw with relief that the coarse
lace draped over her head and face was thick enough to conceal
Sœur Eugénie’s disastrous manifestations of her skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Then she pulled on the white cotton gloves that lay on the
bed and tried to collect her thoughts whilst waiting to be
summoned to the chapel.</p>

<p>It distressed her a little that her mind should still be
vibrating from that little while with Rosamund. Nevertheless
she was aware of an increasing happiness that seemed
to pervade her soul, and to make all lesser, more surface
preoccupations, of no account.</p>

<p>In a few moments she heard the brisk and heavy tread of
the novice-mistress, and rose to meet her.</p>

<p>Mère Thérèse looked at her very kindly, said “Vous êtes
contente, chère petite?” more as though stating a fact than
asking a question, and on the monosyllabic but heartfelt
reply of the novice, blessed her very tenderly. Then she
took her downstairs. Frances followed her obediently to
an unaccustomed entrance of the chapel, that which was
used by the professed nuns, the lady boarders and visitors to
the convent.</p>

<p>The novices always went in and out by a small side-door,
which gave directly on to that part of the chapel
where the community stalls were placed.</p>

<p>But Frances knew that for a <i>prise d’habit</i> the double
doors at the end of the chapel would be opened, and that
she must pass up the narrow aisle thronged on either side
by visitors, and through the light oaken framework of screen
behind which stood the harmonium and the small choir of
nuns and novices, and up to the steps of the Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Rosamund and Lady Argent would be each provided with
a <i>prie-dieu</i> just in front of the railings, where they could see
and hear to the best possible advantage.</p>

<p>“Wait here,” whispered Mère Thérèse, well versed in
every corner of the intricate and inconveniently built
house.</p>

<p>She beckoned Frances into a small angular nook that
served as a little lobby, between the main entrance to the
chapel and the narrow staircase leading to the wing of the
house reserved for the lady boarders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“No one will disturb you. The ladies are all in the chapel
already. Father Anselm has just arrived. You are quite
ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frances gently.</p>

<p>Mère Thérèse, grown strangely materialistic, all the
practical Frenchwoman in her to the fore, arranged the
modest train where it would be least crushed, and put back
the veil that Frances had kept down.</p>

<p>“Vous étoufferiez!” she remarked matter-of-factly.
Then she smoothed back the hair already strained away
from Frances’ temples, said “Voilà!” in tones of satisfaction,
and prepared to leave the novice alone.</p>

<p>Her parting instructions were:</p>

<p>“I will myself be awaiting you at the chapel doors when
you hear the first notes of the <i>Ave Maris Stella</i>. Do not
forget to put your veil down and walk slowly.”</p>

<p>Frances, left alone, sank into the only available seat. She
felt very tired.</p>

<p>She wondered whether Rosamund was already in the
chapel, and wished that she had tried to explain the ceremonial
of a <i>prise d’habit</i> to her sister. Then she derided
herself for supposing that their brief moments of intercourse
could have been spent thus. Besides, she remembered
with relief, Lady Argent would have told Rosamund
what to expect, and there were doubtless innumerable little
paper booklets of an explanatory nature at the disposal of
visitors.</p>

<p>She strove to concentrate her mind on higher thoughts,
but only realized afresh, at the failure of the effort, her own
excessive fatigue, part physical and part emotional.</p>

<p>Presently the stairs began to shake, and a creaking, ponderous
sound of descent became audible.</p>

<p>Frances straightened herself, and reflected with dismay
that she was entirely visible to anyone coming downstairs.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and began to say the Rosary, trying
in vain to fix her attention on the words she uttered mechanically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>The heavy footsteps became incredibly loud, and then
paused in front of her.</p>

<p>“Now don’t,” said Mrs. Mulholland’s voice, “<i>don’t</i> let me
disturb you, my dear. Don’t move—don’t stir—not one
word, my dear, though, of course, there’s no actual rule of
silence for you just now, to-day. If there were, I shouldn’t
be speaking to you, that goes without saying. But we’re
not in silence for a clothing.”</p>

<p>Frances, convinced that Mrs. Mulholland knew all the
convent regulations at least as well as did the Superior herself,
rose, smiling a little.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Mrs. Mulholland zealously, “that’s
right. Now, there’s just one word I wanted to say—I’m
not going to keep you one moment—not that they’re quite
ready for you yet in the chapel. Mère Pauline isn’t in her
place and won’t be, either, for a moment or two. She’s
detained.”</p>

<p>Frances wondered, not for the first time, whence was the
source of the mysterious information that always seemed to
be at Mrs. Mulholland’s finger-tips concerning the movements
of the community, both individually and collectively.</p>

<p>“I knew I should find you here,” pursued the triumphant
old voice. “I delayed coming down on purpose, so as to
catch you. <i>I</i> knew, my dear. The novices always wait just
here for the ‘<i>Ave Maris Stella</i>’ to begin—have done for
years. I’ve seen about twenty <i>prises d’habits</i> in my time—some
of them lay-sisters, some of them choir-sisters. One
or two of them have left, you know, even <i>after</i> taking the
holy Habit of the Order. One English novice we had went
away just when she ought to have been taking her first vows.
Found she had no real vocation, you know. But there’s no
fear of that with you, my dear, is there? From the first
time I saw you here for the Retreat last year, with that nice
friend of yours who wasn’t a Catholic, poor thing, I always
said ‘Miss Grantham has the vocation. Mark my words,’
I said, ‘Miss Grantham has the vocation. She’ll come back
here one of these days,’ I said. And sure enough! Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
well, well, you look very happy, my dear, <i>and</i> in the right
place.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Frances, smiling at her.</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s it. Ah well, there’s nothing like God’s
Holy Will,” said Mrs. Mulholland with an enthusiasm which
was none the less ardent for sounding strangely vague.
“If He’d thought fit to call me to the religious life—but
no doubt I wasn’t worthy. That’s what I always say—not
worthy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland’s voice became cheerfully resigned.
“But there it is,” she said with the air of one reaching a
conclusion, “there it is. One is taken, and the other left.
And your dear sister here for the ceremony and all.”</p>

<p>“Please pray for her, that she mayn’t mind too much,”
said Frances, her eyes suddenly filling with tears. “She
isn’t a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, the sacrifice that you’re both making may bring
a blessing on her—no doubt it will. And tell me, my dear,
what about that nice friend of yours, Mrs. Severing, who
came for the Retreat last year? I hoped we were going to
see her to-day.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t come, but she wrote to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Couldn’t leave the poor son, I dare say. Very
likely—ve-ry likely,” said Mrs. Mulholland with lugubrious
sagacity. “But she’ll have your good prayers, my dear,
and you know you’ll never be refused anything on your
clothing day. That’s really what I came to ask you—to
say a little word for a very special intention of mine. Will
you do that, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said Frances, gently and cordially.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland fumbled for a moment in her enormous
pocket and then drew forth a folded piece of paper.</p>

<p>“Now just let me pin that inside your waistbelt, and I
shall be quite happy. I’ve just dotted down the intention—initials
only, you know—but the Lord will understand. I
should like you to have it on you, my dear, and you can burn
it afterwards, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Frances submitted to Mrs. Mulholland’s rather heavy-handed
manipulation of the old-fashioned ribbon-band
round her waist.</p>

<p>“There now! God bless you, and pray for me; and one
thing more, my dear: You can count on me to say a few
words to your sister. Just a little word of sympathy, or
explanation, to show her that we Catholics——”</p>

<p>There came a sudden sound of voices uplifted in unison
from the chapel.</p>

<p>“<i>Ave Maris Stella!</i>” exclaimed Mrs. Mulholland, and
made Frances precede her out of the narrow lobby.</p>

<p>Thereafter it seemed to Frances that she was conscious
of nothing so much as of the activities of Mrs. Mulholland.
It was Mrs. Mulholland who gave her, as it were, into the
hands of Mère Thérèse, waiting at the entrance of the
chapel, muttering hoarsely: “Here she is, ma Mère, here
she is. Pray for me, dear.”</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Mulholland who squeezed hastily past her
into the chapel and made vehement signals that she was to
advance, and it was Mrs. Mulholland who, by some agency
known only to herself, had caused her own large <i>prie-dieu</i>
to be transferred from its customary corner in the back of
the church to the best possible coign of vantage in a line
with those of Lady Argent and Rosamund.</p>

<p>Even as the “<i>Ave Maris Stella</i>” pealed through the
chapel, and she came slowly up the narrow aisle, it seemed
to Frances that the husky, heartfelt tones of Mrs. Mulholland
sounded above everybody else’s.</p>

<p>And it was undoubtedly Mrs. Mulholland who was whisking
about the leaves of the little books on either side of her,
and guiding her neighbours with an explanatory forefinger.</p>

<p>The little procession of acolytes, preceding the tall tonsured
figure of the Prior of Twickenham, came into the
Sanctuary, and Frances sank upon her knees on the red
velvet cushion before the steps.</p>

<p>And it was only a few moments later, when the customary
prayers had been recited, that she felt a pull at the back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
her dress, and heard the ubiquitous voice of Mrs. Mulholland
behind her.</p>

<p>“Sit down, sit down. He’s going to give the address
now.”</p>

<p>Frances sat down, and Mrs. Mulholland leant forward at
an angle that suffused her large old face with crimson, and
arranged the train of her dress under the chair.</p>

<p>Father Anselm’s address was very short and simple.
There was much that was practical in it, and Frances felt
vaguely relieved that it should contain no mystical allusions
that might vex or distress Rosamund. This our sister, said
the Prior, was about to take a step which, though to the outward
eye might seem more striking, with its symbolical
dress, than the more simple ceremony of a Profession, was
nevertheless only a preliminary step. The goal of our sister’s
religious life was still before her—those vows which
should bind her irrevocably to the life to which she had been
called.</p>

<p>Poverty, Chastity, Obedience. The vow of Poverty,
which would not only mean the relinquishment of worldly
goods and possessions, but also that poverty of spirit which
should claim no rights and no belongings in this world, not
even the rights of personal judgment, the disposal of self....
Then the vow of Chastity, which would discipline our
sister’s earthly affections, rendering them indeed not less
ardent, but more supernatural—a wide and universal charity
which should include all ... our sister had given up her
earthly family ties: good and sacred as they were, the relinquishment
of them was better still—but her family now
would be the poor, the sick, the friendless—in all and each
she would see and love God Himself. Finally, the vow of
Obedience. Our sister would see the Will of God in the
will of her Superior, and would gladly submit to it in greater
as in smaller things. In the Order which our sister had
joined, a nun might be sent at a moment’s notice to some far-off
country, there to live and work and perhaps die, with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
return to the land of her birth. But her home was not here—it
was in the Heaven, towards which every step of the
way was leading her ... where, as the Scriptures themselves
had promised, she would receive again a hundredfold
all that she had given up for Christ’s sake.</p>

<p>The Prior’s voice ceased, and he turned again towards the
Altar.</p>

<p>The time had come for Frances to reply to the few formal
questions that would be put to her. She did so quite steadily,
although her voice sounded strange in her own ears.</p>

<p>Then the habit which she was shortly to don was blessed,
and Prior Anselm fumbled with the scissors and somehow
cut from her head the symbolical lock of hair.</p>

<p>Mère Thérèse held back her veil as he did so, but Frances
was conscious of Mrs. Mulholland hovering over her officiously.</p>

<p>Then she turned and slowly followed the Superior and
Mère Thérèse into the little adjoining Sacristy where Sœur
Eugénie was waiting to divest her of her white satin dress
and lace veil, and help her into the garb which would henceforth
be hers for life.</p>

<p>The white Cross, distinguishing mark of the Order,
gleamed upon her breast now.</p>

<p>She lifted the linen <i>coiffe</i>, ingeniously pinned together,
that bound her head under the veil, but Sœur Eugénie,
laughing a little, pointed to her late handiwork, still erect
upon the head of the novice.</p>

<p>“Allons,” said Mère Thérèse, and began to take out hairpins,
careful to let none fall on the floor, where it might
possibly be overlooked or swept away.</p>

<p>Then the lay-sister put a dustsheet over Frances’ shoulders
and quickly cropped off the lengths of her brown hair.</p>

<p>The feeling of coolness and comfort was pleasant when
the veil was again put on her head, but Frances gave one
curious fleeting pang to the memory of that soft mass, lying
strewn about the dustsheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>The little Superior, who had been busying herself with
the white artificial wreath of roses that lay ready, turned
round.</p>

<p>“Sister Frances Mary”—she greeted the novice by her
new name—“God bless you, my dear daughter.”</p>

<p>Frances knelt for a moment to receive her Superior’s embrace,
and then turned to Mère Thérèse.</p>

<p>“Et maintenant,” said that practical woman, as ever consecrating
the briefest possible time to emotion, however
permissible,—“le baiser le paix aux sœurs.”</p>

<p>This exercise was one which Frances had always viewed
with some slight apprehension.</p>

<p>The newly invested novice, bearing a lighted candle, made
the round of the community, each nun and lay-sister standing
at her stall in the chapel, also the bearer of a lighted
candle, and exchanged with each the symbolical kiss of
peace.</p>

<p>A nervous dread of the effect of so many lighted wax
candles on inflammable veils and music scores sent the blood
to Frances’ head and made her slow progress round the
chapel a painful one, but the older nuns proved expert at
holding veils out of possible contact with candle-grease, and
moreover to her great relief, the draught of these repeated
salutations extinguished several tapers, including her own.</p>

<p>As she returned thankfully to her <i>prie-dieu</i>, Mrs. Mulholland,
who had mysteriously become possessed of a full-sized
candle, leant forward and determinedly applied its flame to
Frances’ cold and extinguished taper.</p>

<p>Frances smiled at her gently, and Mrs. Mulholland subsided
into her seat again and blew her nose with a vigorous,
trumpet-like sound denoting considerable emotion. Then
the Prior read the concluding prayers and placed upon
Frances’ head the wreath of artificial white roses, where it
balanced insecurely until Mrs. Mulholland again sprang
from her seat and affixed it to the novice’s veil with a couple
of safety-pins apparently produced by miraculous means
from her person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>The <i>Te Deum</i> pealed through the chapel in conclusion,
and then, as the community filed out in the customary order,
two by two, Frances was left for a few moments to the solitude
and quiet which her whole soul craved.</p>

<p>Her head bent and her hands tightly clasped, she made
her earnest ardent thanksgiving, her simple, fervent resolution
to try and be worthy of all that she had received, her
tender, childlike petitions for those whom she loved, for all
those for whom she had promised to pray, for that religious
order which she was hereafter to count, in all its scattered
branches, as her earthly home.</p>

<p>She lost herself in a dreamy contentment that was half
contemplation and half the mental inertia following on prolonged
physical and emotional strain. It was almost as
though rousing herself from sleep that she heard a whispered
summons to the parlour, and rose obediently to follow
the lay-sister out of the chapel.</p>

<p>Scarcely less dreamlike was the afternoon spent in Rosamund’s
company, when Frances took her once or twice
round the tiny garden, showed her, in obedience to Mère
Pauline’s recommendations, the poor school and the portion
of the house reserved for lady boarders, and returned with
her to the parlour, where Lady Argent, serenely voluble, was
entertained by such of the nuns as could spare quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>“I can’t see your part of the house, and where you sleep,
can I?” asked Rosamund.</p>

<p>It was almost the first suggestion that she had made,
and Frances divined in her an intense anxiety lest she should
unwittingly distress the novice by proposals or requests
contrary to the mysterious rule of which she knew so little.</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” she added almost immediately, her
eyes on her sister’s face. “I expect you’re not allowed to
have visitors up to your cell.”</p>

<p>There was only the faintest sound of hope underlying the
suggestion now.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” said Frances rather mournfully. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
there’s nothing to see, really. It’s only a little cubicle in a
long dormitory.”</p>

<p>She wondered rather nervously immediately afterwards
whether she ought to have given even that information.
There was so much that might not be discussed outside the
community, and it was so strange to feel such restriction in
her intercourse with Rosamund.</p>

<p>At four o’clock Frances was called away to Vespers, and
tea was brought to the visitors, and at five Lady Argent said
gently:</p>

<p>“My dears, I am going to make a little visit to the chapel,
and in about twenty minutes’ time I am afraid our cab will
be here. Will you come and fetch me?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go into the chapel together for a minute,” whispered
Frances, when the last quarter of an hour had sped
past them.</p>

<p>They knelt at the back of the little chapel, Frances still
conscious of exultation in the joint sacrifice that both were
making. She prayed ardently for her sister and for herself.</p>

<p>The door opened behind them, and the ubiquitous Mrs.
Mulholland sank heavily upon her knees beside Frances.</p>

<p>“The cab is here,” she whispered hoarsely; “and Mère
Pauline and Mère Thérèse are in the hall. You’d better
come, my dear.”</p>

<p>Frances bent her head, the crown of white roses still on
her veil, and an instant later she rose, and left the chapel
with Rosamund and Lady Argent.</p>

<p>The Superior herself had come to bid her guests farewell,
and she spoke kindly to Rosamund, and said that she must
come and pay her sister a visit again next year.</p>

<p>But Mère Thérèse drew Rosamund aside and gave her a
little silver medal. “Comme souvenir de ce beau jour, de la
part de Sœur Françoise Marie,” she said.</p>

<p>Rosamund thanked her, and Frances heard her ask the
novice-mistress in strangled accents if her sister seemed
really happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Mais oui, mais oui. Voyez comme elle a bonne mine.
La santé, c’est un signe de vocation,” asseverated Mère
Thérèse.</p>

<p>“I am really happy—I am in the right place,” Frances
said softly.</p>

<p>She was tense with the determination that no sign of distress
at parting should add to Rosamund’s sense of loss.</p>

<p>The novice-mistress looked at both small, set faces, alike
in spite of Frances’ coiffe and veil, and said approvingly:</p>

<p>“Voilà un sacrifice fait avec courage, n’est ce pas?”</p>

<p>Then Lady Argent kissed Frances, with murmured blessings
and endearments, and went down the steps to the waiting
cab.</p>

<p>The Superior had already hastened away in obedience to
another call.</p>

<p>Mère Thérèse embraced Rosamund, assured her that she
would pray for her, and turned aside for a moment while
the sisters exchanged their speechless farewell.</p>

<p>Frances stood on the steps, with the novice-mistress immediately
behind her, and watched the cab move slowly away
from the convent door, Rosamund still gazing at her from
the window.</p>

<p>Both faces, tense and colourless, were smiling until the cab
was lost to sight.</p>

<p>The novice-mistress looked at Frances kindly, but she did
not say anything except:</p>

<p>“Go and put on your apron, Sister, and help Sœur
Léonide in the refectory. She has been delayed and requires
assistance.”</p>

<p>Frances went.</p>

<p>She made little acts of resignation in her own mind as
she went, and said “Fiat voluntas tua,” but tears, such as
she had not shed since the first strange days of her novitiate,
were choking her, and fell thick and blinding as she donned
her black apron and went into the refectory.</p>

<p>Old Sœur Léonide said “Pauvre chou!” when she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
her, and immediately stuck a pin into her sleeve in order to
remind herself that she must do penance for having spoken
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Then she showed Frances what had to be done, and they
worked quickly and in silence until the bell rang.</p>

<p>At the evening recreation the novices all congratulated
Frances, and called her “Sœur Françoise Marie,” and she
was ashamed of the tears that she could not stop, although
no one made any comment on them.</p>

<p>The evening recital of the office calmed her at last, and
she again renewed her offering of herself and of all that she
held dear.</p>

<p>That night, in the dormitory, she had occasion to go to the
can of luke-warm water that stood beside the uncurtained
window at the end of the long room. Forgetful for a moment
of her surroundings, Frances looked out on the still
patch of garden lying below, bathed in a white flood of
moonlight.</p>

<p>Just so had she seen the garden at Porthlew on summer
evenings, just so would it be flooded now. The same white
light would stream now, strong and peaceful, over that
smaller garden, on a hill above the Wye Valley. It was
perhaps visible from the surroundings, unknown to Frances,
amidst which Rosamund now was.</p>

<p>The thought, which was a sufficiently obvious one, suddenly
struck Frances, in her overwrought state, as strange
and piteous.</p>

<p>She looked out at the moonlit garden with a rush of longing
and sorrow for Rosamund.</p>

<p>A great clock outside struck the half-hour with a loud
clang, making her start violently.</p>

<p>Half-past nine—and it was the evening of her <i>prise
d’habit</i>.</p>

<p>Sister Frances Mary turned from the window and went
into her cell.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IPHIGENIA,” said Ludovic Argent in London that
evening.</p>

<p>His mother looked distressed.</p>

<p>“My dearest boy, I do wish you wouldn’t call her that.
It would make Rosamund more unhappy than she is already,
if she heard you, and, besides, dear little Frances
isn’t in the least like any heathen goddess of that sort. Not
that I quite know what Iphigenia ever did, but I’m sure from
your tone that it was something dreadful, and enough to
expel her from any decent religious order.”</p>

<p>“She was only very young—and innocent—and sacrificed,”
said Ludovic.</p>

<p>“Just as I say!” untruly remarked Lady Argent, in a
tone of triumph. “<i>Most</i> unlike Frances, who is as happy
as she can be, and made her sacrifice entirely of her own
free will, as you perfectly well know. Unless, Ludovic, you
want to make me think that you still believe in those shocking
old myths of nuns being walled up alive and lured into
convents because of their fortunes, which one knows perfectly
well never happened at all, even in the Middle Ages,
let alone nowadays with Government inspections and sanitary
improvements and everything.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think they’re walling her up, mother,” Ludovic
allowed, with the shadow of a smile crossing his habitually
melancholy face. “But when you say she’s made her
sacrifice of her own free will—well, she doesn’t yet know
what it is that she’s giving up, does she?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Lady Argent with a sort of wistful decision
that gave unwonted lucidity to her utterance, “perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
she knows what she’s gaining, better than what she’s
giving up, Ludovic.”</p>

<p>Ludovic found no reply.</p>

<p>Presently he asked: “Where is Miss Grantham?”</p>

<p>“I sent her upstairs as soon as we got back. Ludovic,
I wish I knew what to do for her. She minds this dreadfully,
poor child, and it’s so difficult to make her see it from
a Catholic point of view. She was very, very good and
brave, for fear of distressing her sister, but she kept on getting
whiter and whiter, and in a way it was really a relief
when we got away from the convent, and she could relax
that dreadful strain.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard on her.”</p>

<p>“Dreadfully,” said Lady Argent, with tears in her eyes.
“You see, what can one say to comfort her? Talking about
the Will of God seems such a mockery, when she isn’t a
Catholic.”</p>

<p>“My dear mother! Catholics haven’t got a monopoly of
the Will of God.”</p>

<p>“I never for a moment said they had, Ludovic!” cried
his mother agitatedly. “The rain falleth upon the just and
the unjust, and all that, as I <i>perfectly</i> well know, but all I
meant was that poor dear Rosamund can’t be expected to
look upon it as being the Will of God at all. It just seems to
her a sort of fanatical idea of making oneself as miserable
as possible.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” said her son dryly, “the misery isn’t
confined to the fanatic. Other people suffer for his act, and
have, as you may say, no compensating belief in the reward
to follow.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Lady Argent very earnestly, “is the worst
part of it. I mean, knowing that one is making the people
one loves suffer. If there’s one thing absolutely certain,
Ludovic, it is that Frances minds infinitely more for Rosamund’s
sake than for her own—in fact, of course, she
doesn’t mind at all, as far as she herself is concerned, since
she’s deliberately chosen it. But you know what a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
tender-hearted thing she is, and how devoted they’ve always
been—and then you talk about her making Rosamund suffer!
which, of course, she’s doing, poor little dear, but you
may be sure it’s every bit as bad for her.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be a vicious circle,” remarked Ludovic
grimly.</p>

<p>He began to limp up and down the length of the room,
slowly.</p>

<p>The relation between Rosamund and Frances had always
been a thought that could move him profoundly, for reasons
which he had never sought to analyze. Perhaps it was the
memory of the two children who had been brought across
the valley to see his mother by Mrs. Tregaskis. At all
events he could recall at will, and always with that sensation
of acute and impotent compassion, the child Rosamund who
had crouched on the ground to listen outside a closed door.</p>

<p>He thought of her now.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he demanded abruptly, “let me know how it
stands. Has she taken any vows yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. This was only her <i>prise d’habit</i>. She gets her
religious name, you know, and all her hair is cut off—not
that the Prior really did cut it with those blunt old scissors
under her veil—quite impossible. It must have been properly
done afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Then she could still change her mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if she wanted to. She won’t take even her first
vows for another year, and then they’ll only be temporary
ones. The Church is very prudent in these matters, Ludovic.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” said Ludovic, with no marked conviction
in his tones.</p>

<p>“Well, at all events, she’s not bound herself down yet,
and she’s very young. Would there be any difficulty about
her coming away if she wanted to?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, my dear boy. Don’t suggest anything so
preposterous. Anybody would think,” said Lady Argent
plaintively, “that you were like Sir Walter Scott or somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
dreadful of that kind, who always wrote as though the
Church was a most barbarous institution, and convents and
monasteries only good for extermination. Of course they
would let Frances go in a minute if she wasn’t happy. It’s
a question of <i>vocation</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ludovic hopefully, “there’s still a chance,
then, that she may find she’s mistaken her vocation.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lady Argent reluctantly, “and I’m afraid
that Rosamund is building on that. She keeps saying: ‘It
can’t last—it’s only a phase. Francie will come away
again.’ But, indeed, Ludovic, I don’t think she will.”</p>

<p>“If it’s any comfort to her sister, mother, I should let
her think it. Anyhow, it gives her time to become more
reconciled to the idea, before the whole thing is made irrevocable.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent shook her head, and said that dear Ludovic
knew nothing about it, and what was the use of living in a
fool’s paradise, though of course one couldn’t exactly say
that poor Rosamund was in any sort of paradise just now,
but she ended by following her son’s advice and allowing
Rosamund to dwell on the thought that sooner or later
Frances would relinquish her convent life.</p>

<p>Ludovic, however, observant and speculative, came to the
conclusion, during the few days she spent with them in London,
that there was no conviction in Rosamund’s assertion
that sooner or later her sister would return to her.</p>

<p>He would have liked to talk to Rosamund, the instinct of
compassion within him reminding him strangely of their
first meeting in the Wye Valley days.</p>

<p>But she hardly appeared to be conscious of his existence,
and Ludovic was too intuitive not to be aware that her every
faculty was still absorbed in Frances, and Frances only.</p>

<p>On the evening before she left London, however, Ludovic
obtained a few words with Rosamund.</p>

<p>He found her in the hall, looking wistfully at the letters
which had just come in by the last post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>She looked up with a faint smile at the sound of his crutch
upon the tiles.</p>

<p>“It’s very foolish, but I keep thinking that I shall have a
letter from Frances,” she said. “And all the time I know
quite well she isn’t allowed to write more than once a week—and
even that is only supposed to be a very special concession.”</p>

<p>“In Heaven’s name, why? What <i>is</i> the object of it
all?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a shade more colour in her face
as though she was grateful for his vehemence.</p>

<p>“I can’t really see any object in it, myself, but from their
point of view it’s—it’s self-sacrifice, and so it becomes desirable.”</p>

<p>“To propitiate a Being whom they call the God of
Love?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I don’t know. You see,” said Rosamund,
“it’s only the personal application that matters to me.
Cousin Bertha says I am very egotistical, and I think it’s
true. Nothing seems to matter to me <i>at all</i>, except just
Frances and me, now. Nothing else seems in the least real.
Once I thought something else was, but it was only a mistake.
It didn’t really get down to bedrock at all—not half
so much as with one little-finger-ache of Frances.’ I suppose
everyone has something which is realest in the world,
besides which other things simply don’t count.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite true,” said Ludovic, wondering if it was a
relief to her to talk. “The true secret of life has always
seemed to me to lie in the focussing of that one especial
thing which is the most real to each of us. So many people
don’t know what it is, or they may know, and wilfully blind
themselves because it is contrary to a conventional ideal.”</p>

<p>“I would much rather have thought that Morris had
broken my heart and spoilt my whole life, than that he was
merely an incident,” murmured Rosamund, as though to
herself. “That was a conventional ideal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Ludovic was struck by the fundamental sincerity of her
outlook. He looked at her tired, downcast face and said
nothing.</p>

<p>“But now,” she told him, gazing straight at him, “I know
that nothing in my life has mattered at all, so far except
just Frances and the ordinary primitive facts of our being
sisters, and having been children together.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Ludovic gently, “that the ordinary primitive
facts are the ones that one does come back to in the long
run, always, as the things that matter most.”</p>

<p>“Frances hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“She is very young,” said Ludovic pitifully. “Don’t you
think she may change her mind?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Rosamund. “If I didn’t think
that, day and night, I should go mad. If I thought it would
go on like this always—I couldn’t bear it.”</p>

<p>Ludovic knew that nothing goes on always, that the
strongest, swiftest tide knows but its ebb and flow, but he
would not tell her so then.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think she will come away?” she asked him
urgently, as though she could not bear the thought that his
silence might imply a dissent.</p>

<p>“I hope with all my heart that she may, for her sake
and for yours,” he said gravely. “But—if you knew she
was happy there, and wanted to stay?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what would happen then,” she said. “It’s
as though my mind stopped, when I think of that. I just
can’t imagine any further.”</p>

<p>She covered her eyes with her hand, and then turned
slowly to go upstairs.</p>

<p>Ludovic saw that she had forgotten his presence.</p>

<p>He stood looking after her rather wistfully, and suddenly
she turned and came back to him.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said rather breathlessly. “You are
the only person who has seemed to understand at all.”</p>

<p>He was left with a strange sense of having found the child
Rosamund again, and with an absolute conviction that, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
spite of all her assertions as to Frances’ return to the world,
she yet knew them to be vain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Rosamund clung passionately to those assertions,
both then and on her return to Porthlew. They
seemed in some strange, inadequate way, to protect her
from Bertha’s regretful philosophy and resignation, and
from Minnie’s bland assumptions and consolations.</p>

<p>“After all, we live and learn, and it takes all sorts to make
a world. That’s why it’s such a queer one, I suppose. At
least, it’s not the world, so much as the people in it.”</p>

<p>Thus Miss Blandflower, surpassing herself. And adding,
with regretful shakings of the head:</p>

<p>“Poor dear little Frances! But I suppose it’s as it will
be, you know.”</p>

<p>“Minnie, my dear woman, you’re a fool,” said Mrs. Tregaskis
bluntly. “What on earth can you possibly mean by
‘it’s as it will be’? And if you <i>do</i> mean anything, of
what consolation is it to this poor little <i>mater dolorosa</i>
here?”</p>

<p>She laid her hand kindly on Rosamund’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower had lived with Mrs. Tregaskis for a
number of years, had a whole-hearted adoration for her, and
was not at all sensitive. Neither was this the first time that
her dear Mrs. Tregaskis, with playful candour, had called
her a fool. She therefore smiled with great placidity, and
said deprecatingly:</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Tregaskis! I always say you’re such a
purist—always catching one up. I’m afraid I’m dreadfully
slipshod in my way of speaking sometimes—but while
there’s life there’s hope. You may yet cure me, in my old
age.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it very much, Minnie,” said Bertha briskly, to
which Miss Blandflower thoughtfully rejoined:</p>

<p>“I doubt it, said the carpenter, and shed a bitter tear,”
which saying Bertha had so long regarded as part of Minnie’s
stock equipment that she scarcely heard it, and addressed
herself to Rosamund again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“Well now, daughter mine, I want to hear all about the
child.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis had sometimes employed this proprietary
form of address in speaking to Rosamund since Hazel’s
marriage. She seldom used the words lightly, however, but
as though to denote some deeper sympathy or kindness.</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at her unintelligently.</p>

<p>Her head felt stupefied from the tears she had shed, violently
and uncontrollably, during the few days she had spent
with Lady Argent, and she was far more physically shaken
by the strength of her undisciplined emotions than she
realized.</p>

<p>On the night of her return to Porthlew, Cousin Bertie
had said very kindly: “I see how it is, my child,” and had
sent her to bed at once, and come up twice to see that Rosamund
had all she wanted, and was really going to sleep.
She had asked no questions, only saying: “You shall tell
me all about it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And now to-morrow had come, and Rosamund, who had
slept heavily and dreamlessly until after nine o’clock, was
to tell them all that had happened during her brief stay at
the convent, all the details about Frances that her little circle
wanted to know, give them all the loving messages that
Frances had sent.</p>

<p>She wished dully that she could apply some kind of spur
to her brain, which felt oddly and inexplicably incapable of
transmitting into images any impression of the convent she
had visited. Even her tongue felt curiously weighted, as
though speech were an almost impossible effort.</p>

<p>“Come,” said her guardian encouragingly, “how does the
little thing like it? Her letters don’t tell one very much,
but perhaps that isn’t altogether her fault.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Miss Bandflower, shaking her head, “I always
thought those letters of hers were not what I call
<i>spontaneous</i>. Like being in prison for her, isn’t it—practically?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Rosamund whitened, and Frederick Tregaskis remarked
in a detached tone:</p>

<p>“I suppose that by ‘practically’ you merely mean, like
every other woman, ‘theoretically.’”</p>

<p>“He! he! he!” giggled Minnie nervously, as she invariably
did when addressed by Frederick, thereby causing him
to cast upon her an infuriated glance of contempt, as he relapsed
into his habitual silence.</p>

<p>“Do you think she’s happy?” asked Bertha, looking
sharply up from her knitting.</p>

<p>“She said she was, and that she felt in the right place.”</p>

<p>“A place for everything and everything in its place,”
muttered Minnie. “Ah well!”</p>

<p>“H’m! She evidently knows better than the Almighty
then, since the place <i>He</i> put her into was Porthlew, in my
opinion. However, she’s like so many of her generation—finding
it easier to serve abroad than to be served at home.
Poor little girl! Did she look well, Rosamund?”</p>

<p>“Fairly.”</p>

<p>“Only fairly?”</p>

<p>“She’s less thin than she used to be, but her eyes looked
tired, I thought.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like nerves,” said Miss Blandflower, shaking
her head with a sapient expression.</p>

<p>She had persisted in looking upon Frances as a victim to
“nerves” ever since she had first heard of her wishing to
leave Porthlew for the convent.</p>

<p>“Want of sleep, probably,” said Frederick.</p>

<p>A dull pang went through Rosamund at the words, though
they only confirmed her own sick apprehensions and surmises,
and she said apathetically:</p>

<p>“Yes. They get up at five every morning, always.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, but they go to bed early, don’t they?”
sensibly remarked Mrs. Tregaskis.</p>

<p>“About half-past nine, I think. That’s when they all
leave the chapel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there you are. It doesn’t hurt anyone to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
up early if they go to bed early enough. It’s the sleep that
you get before midnight that counts, you know,” said Mrs.
Tregaskis comfortably.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘Early to bed and early to rise</div>
<div class="verse">Makes little folks healthy, wealthy, and wise,’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>added Miss Blandflower encouragingly. She was generally
late for breakfast herself, but more from innate unpunctuality
than because she failed to rise between seven and
eight o’clock every morning.</p>

<p>“Well, Rosamund, dear, can’t you tell us a little something
about the ceremony? Was it pretty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it was, Cousin Bertie.”</p>

<p>Rosamund racked her brains. If only she did not feel
utter inability to speak!</p>

<p>Once or twice before in her life this same sensation, which
she could only translate into physical terms by telling herself
that her tongue felt as though it were weighted, had assailed
her.</p>

<p>She thought of it as a sort of partial paralysis, and something
of the blankness of her sensations was reflected in her
speechless fixity of gaze. Her guardian looked at her.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, old lady,” she suddenly said with all
her characteristic authoritative kindness in her voice, “I
don’t want to drag this out of you bit by bit, if you feel it’s
rather more than you can stand just yet. But remember
that Frances is my child as well as your sister, and we all
love her and want to hear about her. I don’t approve of
what’s she’s done, and I don’t choose to go and countenance
a performance of which I dislike the idea as much as I do
that wedding-dress business. But I was glad and willing
that you should go, as you know, and I want news of her—so
do we all. Now, Rosamund, if you’re too sore to talk
about any of it, just say so, and we’ll try to make allowances
and wait until you can overcome yourself a little for the sake
of other people. But once for all—I’m not going to pump
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>Mrs. Tregaskis set her lips in a very determined way indeed,
and knitted vigorously, and Miss Blandflower, seizing
upon her last words, repeated vaguely: “It is the pump,
the village pump.”</p>

<p>Rosamund sought for words desperately.</p>

<p>She evolved at last a halting, stammered, lifeless account
of the <i>prise d’habit</i>, of Mrs. Mulholland’s officiousness, of
the afternoon in the garden with Frances, and the interview
with the novice-mistress.</p>

<p>“They’re satisfied with her, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. The nuns told Lady Argent that Frances was
<i>trés docile—tout a fait l’habitude de l’obéissance</i>.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” laughed Bertha. “She owes something to her
wicked old heathen guardian, after all, then. I venture to
think that <i>l’habitude de l’obéissance</i> was picked up at Porthlew.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” was the contribution of Mrs. Tregaskis’
husband to the conversation. “Frances was submissive by
nature, and it would have cost her a great deal more to disobey
than to give in.”</p>

<p>Frederick was too much apt to speak of his wife’s departed
protégée in the past tense, but Rosamund shot him a
look of gratitude for the understanding which his speech
seemed to denote.</p>

<p>“She may have been submissive, Frederick,” his wife said
quietly, “but you don’t have to look very far to see that
Frances was self-righteous enough to blind her to her own
self-will. Look at the way she left this house.”</p>

<p>“She thought she was doing right,” said Rosamund
quickly.</p>

<p>“I know that perfectly well. I understand Frances,
Rosamund, quite as well as you do—better, perhaps, since
I’m an experienced old lady who’s seen something of human
nature. But that’s neither here nor there. We’ve discussed
the ethics of the case often enough. The child’s taken her
own way, and I want to hear something about how she’s
getting on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“I think she’s happy,” said Rosamund rather doggedly.
Bertha looked doubtful, and said with rather a curt laugh:
“Well, I suppose getting one’s own way makes up for a
good deal.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” observed her husband. “You can see a
striking example of the advantageous results of self-will in
our daughter Hazel, Bertha.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis, who never made any reference to that
side of Hazel’s marriage which was oftenest in her thoughts,
flushed her heavy infrequent red and remained silent.</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower looked frightened.</p>

<p>“I am afraid the day will come,” she remarked courageously,
“when Hazel, as well as poor dear little Frances,
will wish she hadn’t taken her own way and ... and flown
in the face——” Her voice trailed away feebly.</p>

<p>Lady Marleswood had become yearly more radiantly prosperous
and happy since her marriage, but Minnie still clung
faithfully to the thought of the day that would come, even
while rejoicing admiringly at the occasional glimpses vouchsafed
to Porthlew of Hazel and her happiness.</p>

<p>Bertha Tregaskis broke the silence abruptly.</p>

<p>“Did you give her my message about her money affairs,
Rosamund, and what does she want to do?”</p>

<p>“She said she would have to make a will after she comes
of age, when she takes her vows. It seems to be quite a
usual thing for nuns to do.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” snorted Frederick. “Supervised by the
Mother Superior, I presume?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said his wife shortly. “I don’t imagine
they’ll turn up their noses at three hundred a year.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she’ll have left before then,” said Miss Blandflower
hopefully, and Rosamund, far from exalted as her
opinion generally was of Minnie’s prognostications, looked
at her gratefully.</p>

<p>“Listen to my words of wisdom, dear, and you’ll see I’m
right,” declared Minnie, encouraged by any unwonted signs
of attention, so few of which ever came her way. “<i>I</i> undercumstumble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
our little Francesca—we shall see her trotting
home one of these days, you mark my words.”</p>

<p>Little though Porthlew was in the habit of marking Miss
Blandflower’s words, they brought a shred of comfort to
Rosamund.</p>

<p>She was striving with passionate intensity to persuade
herself that Frances would leave the convent before taking
vows there, and that her desire for the religious life was only
a phase.</p>

<p>Even when the months went on and her sister’s letters
gave no sign of a possible return, Rosamund told herself
that in the next letter Frances would ask to be taken away.
She could not face any other possibility, and felt, as she had
told Ludovic, as though her very imagination stopped at,
and could never take in, the prospect of a future without
Frances, with Frances permanently established in a strange,
new life where one would never know anything of her inner
existence, and might not even be told if she were ill or unhappy.</p>

<p>The thought to her was unendurable.</p>

<p>She had no natural tendency towards religion, and very
little belief in any beneficent Deity, but she took to a sort
of frenzied praying, that the God whom Frances worshipped
might reject her sacrifice.</p>

<p>The material aspects of convent life, as Rosamund had
seen them during her day at the convent, began to obsess
her. She obtained books that told of the lives of nuns, the
foundations of religious orders, and the rule prevailing
there. The accounts of some of the physical austerities
practised by the more ascetic orders turned her sick, and her
nights began to be haunted by visions of Frances, starved
and emaciated, bleeding under the self-imposed lash of a
knotted scourge.</p>

<p>“I am exaggerating—I am going mad,” Rosamund told
herself. “Frances is well and happy—her letters say so.”</p>

<p>“<i>But her letters are read before they reach me.</i>”</p>

<p>She writhed at the thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Her very ignorance of convent life added to the sense of
horror which was gradually taking possession of her imagination.</p>

<p>She looked back upon the days when she and Frances and
Hazel had been children together as at some incredible other
life, full of a security so supreme that it had been undreamed
of by any of them.</p>

<p>In vain Rosamund told herself, with a piteous attempt at
readjusting her focus upon life, that change was only development,
that alteration was bound to mark the inevitable
way of progress.</p>

<p>“Not this way,” her anguish protested wildly. “Not
this way. Hazel has cut herself off to a certain extent
by her own voluntary act, but at least she is happy and free—and
my Francie—how do I know her to be either?”</p>

<p>Only two things stood out saliently in the darkness which
encompassed Rosamund’s soul: her resolution not to add to
the cost of Frances’ sacrifice by any pleadings of her own,
and her anguished trembling hope that Frances might yet
relinquish that way which seemed so fraught with suffering
for them both.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT Pensevern, Mrs. Severing had received one of her
son’s infrequent, and generally ill-timed, suggestions
of a return to the parental roof.</p>

<p>“Will join you in London,” was Nina’s immediate telegraphic
reply.</p>

<p>She did not definitely assure herself that she wished to
preclude, as far as might be, the possibility of a <i>rapprochement</i>
between her son and Rosamund Grantham, but situations
in which Nina Severing did not play the principal rôle
were ever distasteful to her, and she gracefully eluded the
possibility of involving herself in such a situation by a murmured
fear that Morris would find Pensevern and the depths
of the country too uneventful.</p>

<p>Having skilfully guarded against events which might
serve to vary the uneventful, Nina felt able to rejoice in the
self-sacrifice of leaving “the beloved country and God’s
own peace and quiet there” in favour of the Ritz Hotel.</p>

<p>Morris, within twenty-four hours of her arrival there,
disconcerted her by inquiring, with a piercing glance,
whether Rosamund was at Porthlew.</p>

<p>Nina raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said easily. “Why should she be anywhere
else? She always is at Porthlew.”</p>

<p>“I heard she was in London with the Argents the other
day.”</p>

<p>“The other day! What nonsense you talk, Morris.
Rosamund spent two or three nights with them just about
Easter-time, so as to go down to poor little Frances’ ceremony,
whatever it was.”</p>

<p>“What a shame it is to let a little thing like that go and
shut herself up for life,” said Morris warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>Nina immediately looked pained.</p>

<p>“There are one or two ways of looking at it,” she said
slowly. “I don’t like to hear you making sweeping assertions
like that, Morris, especially when you know nothing
about the matter. It doesn’t matter when you only say it
to me, of course, though it’s neither very polite nor very
dutiful, but I should dislike it very much if anyone else
were to hear you laying down the law as you sometimes do.”</p>

<p>Morris was aware that there were indeed few things that
his mother disliked more than to hear him express an independent
opinion on any subject whatever, and he consequently
said, with a decision of manner that almost bordered
upon violence:</p>

<p>“My dear mother, there really can’t be two opinions
about the question of a child of eighteen or nineteen being
allowed to take vows which will bind her to a life of that
sort. It’s simply iniquitous.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a child, Morris!” exclaimed his parent,
pale with annoyance. “But it only makes me laugh, a little
sadly, to hear you. You’ll feel so very differently in a few
years’ time.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” declared Morris easily. “A friend of mine—no
one whom you’d know, mother dear—has gone into
that sort of thing a good deal, and is thinking of being a
Trappist monk. We’ve naturally had a good deal of discussion
on the subject.”</p>

<p>Nina gazed at her son with a freezing eye. It gave her
the most acute sensation of annoyance every time that she
realized afresh in him the self-opinionated arrogance which
he derived from her.</p>

<p>“My poor boy,” she said at last, “you don’t really suppose,
do you, that your discussion of any of the real things
of life can count for anything? Why, your opinions have
no more value, to those of us who <i>know</i>, than the little idle
chirpings of a baby bird that thinks it knows how to fly
without waiting to be taught.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>The vigor of this trenchant simile carried Nina sublimely
past its ornithological inexactitude, and she recovered
her poise of mind.</p>

<p>“Little Frances will have a very beautiful, peaceful, sheltered
life,” she observed thoughtfully. “She has shirked
all the responsibility, all the sorrow and suffering, that others
have to face. She will never grow up—life will always
be a soft, childish, happy dream for her. It’s a very easy
way out.”</p>

<p>Morris gazed at her with the expression which both of
them felt to pertain to one who knew better.</p>

<p>“That remains open to question,” he enunciated with
thoughtful deliberation. “To those outside, the idle, the
rich, the thoughtless, it may seem a sheltered life in a garden
of roses—but what about the vigils and fastings and
scourgings, mother?”</p>

<p>“Morris,” inquired his mother coldly, “what have you
been reading?”</p>

<p>Her son left the room in a fury.</p>

<p>That night at dinner he refused several courses with an
air of asceticism, and drank only water, feeling that in
some subtle manner this abstemiousness justified his attitude
of the morning. Nina, perfectly following the workings of
this strange law, remained serenely unmoved.</p>

<p>The astonishing ease with which Nina and Morris invariably
penetrated one another’s poses was perhaps due
less to years of practice than to the fundamental similarity
of their methods and outlook.</p>

<p>It was no surprise to Morris Severing, although it irritated
him very considerably, when two days later, Nina exclaimed
over her correspondence in impassioned accents:</p>

<p>“Bertie Tregaskis is miserable about Frances—miserable!
And no wonder. The child has written that she isn’t
well—has been in the infirmary or something—some kind
of epidemic, I imagine, as the Superior is ill too, which
seems to be all that Frances writes about. She gives <i>no</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
details about herself, and persists in declaring that she’s perfectly
happy and doesn’t want to come away. It’s scandalous.”</p>

<p>“What is?” coldly inquired Morris, who had not forgotten
Nina’s recent reception of his views on the cloistered
life.</p>

<p>“This convent system. I’ve a very good mind....”</p>

<p>Nina assumed an aspect of deep consideration and of a
preoccupation which Morris did not judge sufficiently deep
to prevent his gazing with ostentatious inattention out of
the window.</p>

<p>“A <i>very</i> good mind,” Nina repeated, and paused. Morris
took advantage of the pause, which his parent obviously
desired broken by a question, to light a cigarette with every
appearance of deliberation and in perfect silence.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Severing’s determinations were not easily
baffled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said thoughtfully, and thereby with great skill
bridging over the pause, “I’m not at all sure I oughtn’t
to go down there myself.”</p>

<p>Morris raised his eyebrows, an exercise ever effectual in
conveying to his mother various undutiful sentiments which
could not easily have been put into words.</p>

<p>“To Porthlew, mother?” he inquired, aware that she
meant to the convent.</p>

<p>“Why do you say ‘to Porthlew,’ Morris, when you know
perfectly well that I don’t mean that at all? Your affectation
is unbearable, and no one but your mother would put
up with it. I’m forbearing and long-suffering with you,
because you’re my son, but who else in the world, do you
suppose, would have patience with your endless petty insincerities
and your insolent manners?”</p>

<p>This profitless inquiry, which Nina had hurled at her son
some three times a week from the date of his tenth birthday,
he allowed to drop unheeded.</p>

<p>Nina, having voiced her annoyance that Morris had not
put the obvious inquiry which she had meant him to put as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
to her newly-taken decision, allowed a moment to elapse,
and then resumed in ordinary conversational tones:</p>

<p>“They know me at the convent, and they’ll let <i>me</i> see her,
all right. I could tell in one moment how things were.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought Mrs. Tregaskis would be the best
person to go, or Rosamund.”</p>

<p>“Rosamund!” Nina laughed, shrilly, as she herself recognized
with inward annoyance. “Rosamund is a little girl,
my dear Morris. A child is of no use. It’s a matter for a
woman of the world, with tact and experience. As for poor
dear Bertie, with her sledge-hammer ways, I’m afraid she’d
be worse than useless. But the Superior knows me—dear
Mère Pauline!”</p>

<p>Nina, with a slight effort, recalled the name of the Superior,
and uttered it with a marked effect of intimacy.</p>

<p>Morris laughed a little.</p>

<p>“You could hardly count on her remembering you, could
you, considering that it’s nearly two years since you went
down for those few days, and were so terribly bored? I
shall never forget coming down to fetch you home, and how
thankful you were to get away from it all!”</p>

<p>“Morris,” said Nina with dignity, replying to the spirit
which had prompted this ingeniously perverted reminiscence,
“if you can speak like that to your widowed mother, there
is no more to be said to you.”</p>

<p>Nina seldom claimed official rank, as it were, as Morris’
widowed mother, until the last outpost of her endurance had
been reached, and as Morris was in reality sincerely grateful
to her for never having presented him with a stepfather, he
changed his tactics.</p>

<p>“Of course, you could quite well go down from here for
the day, but do you really think there’s anything wrong? If
she was really ill, they’d send for Mrs. Tregaskis, I suppose.
Anyway, she’s always been more or less delicate, hasn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“That sort of quiet, regular life ought to have made her
quite strong,” said Nina negligently. “I must say, though,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
this is the first time one’s heard of her having a day’s illness
there. The ungrateful little thing has never written to me,
either, except one rather stilted, affected letter, just after
she’d been given her religious habit. Evidently she was so
pleased with the novelty of it all, she couldn’t help rather
playing a part. Poor little thing! It didn’t ring quite true,
somehow, when she spoke of praying for one, and signed
herself, ‘Yours affectionately in Christ, Sister Frances
Mary.’”</p>

<p>Morris laughed, with a note of indulgence that appeared
to Nina’s sensitive perceptions to savour somewhat too
nearly of superiority.</p>

<p>“That sort of posing never rings quite true, if very young
people would only realize it,” she said, skillfully transferring
her condemnation from the particular to the general, whence
it might safely be assumed to include her son.</p>

<p>“Frances was anything but a <i>poseuse</i>, mother.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you haven’t the least idea—how could you
at your age—of the effect that an atmosphere of that sort
can have on a silly, impressionable girl. Poor little Frances
probably wrote in that exaggerated convent style simply
because she thought it would impress me with her holiness,”
said the discerning Mrs. Severing.</p>

<p>Morris shook his head, and even indulged in the cheap
provocation of slightly curling his lip.</p>

<p>“However that may be,” he said tolerantly, and disregarded
Nina’s interpolated: “I’ve just told you how it
is——” “However that may be, mother, if you really want
to go down there, we could take the car to-morrow. It
would be a really long run.”</p>

<p>He was quite aware that his mother had never for a moment
seriously entertained the project of raiding the convent
and obtaining an interview with Frances.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Nina austerely. “I shall have to
consider very carefully, Morris. It’s not the sort of undertaking
that can be lightly rushed into.”</p>

<p>“Why not? The car is running beautifully just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Nina gave him a glance of contemptuous rebuke. She
could be flippant herself, but the flippancy of Morris caused
her acute vexation.</p>

<p>“You are too inexperienced to know how extremely
cautiously one may have to move in this sort of matter,” she
said coldly. “People talk only too readily, and for the sake
of poor little Frances, I don’t want gossip about her being
kept at the convent against her will.”</p>

<p>“Considering she didn’t know a soul to speak of, and
wasn’t even ‘come out’ before she went, I don’t think anyone
is very likely to talk about her, I must say. Besides,
no one is particularly likely to know whether you go down
there or not, surely?” inquired Morris in tones of simplicity.</p>

<p>Few things, indeed, were better calculated to annoy the
composer of the “Kismet” series than an assumption that
her movements were left unchronicled and unregarded by
the public eye. She now laughed with all the violent amusement
so frequently simulated by intense fury.</p>

<p>“My dear, ridiculous boy! You’ve no idea how you
make me laugh—if anybody could <i>hear</i> you! Do you really
think that your little, stupid, childish innuendoes, which one
can see through so easily, can touch <i>me</i>—an experienced
woman of the world?”</p>

<p>Nina made this inquiry of her son so frequently that only
an infinitesimal pause was ever consecrated by either of
them to the reply which Morris invariably confined to a
sudden sulky lowering of his whole expression. He had
brought the production of this look to a fine art, and it gave
an admirable representation of frank happy-hearted youth
and confidence sharply transformed into sullen, hopeless
misery by the recurrence of an unjust, and yet oft-repeated,
attack.</p>

<p>Inwardly, he was always rather relieved when his parent
proceeded to definite rhetoric. It justified his own sense of
grievance far more effectually than the covert and undignified
verbal sparring which marked their more surface intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>When Nina pitched her voice some three semitones
lower than its natural note and said,“The day will come,
my poor Morris——” her son felt that she was safely embarked
upon a course well known to them both, and merely
retained his sombre expression by a mechanical effort of
will.</p>

<p>The successive stages of Nina’s contempt, her amused
toleration, and at the same time her almost supernatural supply
of patience and love for the blind and erring Morris,
were reached and left behind, the youth and ignorance and
folly of Morris and the store of regrets and bitter memories
awaiting him in that future when Nina’s understanding and
forgiveness would no longer be available, were all touched
upon with the sure hand of long practice, and the final
peroration beginning, “Ah, if youth but knew!” was almost
in sight when Nina suddenly, and, her son considered, most
unjustly, interpolated into her discourse a reference which
she seldom made us of, and which always disquieted Morris
profoundly.</p>

<p>“And, mind you, Morris, you won’t be able to go on like
this with impunity, heartless and undutiful, and ungrateful
to your mother, trading on her never giving you away to
other people. The day will come when people <i>will</i> know,
and <i>will</i> talk about it. That sort of thing doesn’t remain
hidden for ever. You know very well that I would rather
die than betray you, but—later on—that sort of thing
comes out, Morris.”</p>

<p>Morris’ thoughts, not for the first time, fled apprehensively
to his mother’s diaries.</p>

<p>These volumes, slowly accumulating ever since he could
remember, had always held for him a subtle menace.</p>

<p>He knew that Mrs. Severing flew to them for solace, and
had seen her more than once, with tears still gleaming on
her golden lashes, bent over her desk, after interviews with
her son similar to the present one.</p>

<p>And although Morris did not take his parent’s fame as a
composer at her own valuation, he had never been devoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
of an uneasy conviction that she meant to present posterity
with her own conception of the author of the “Kismet”
series, and a lively apprehension had consequently circled
for him round the thought of her diaries almost ever since
he could remember.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he said sullenly, and
wishing that he did not.</p>

<p>Nina looked at him pityingly.</p>

<p>“You must know very well, Morris, that your mother is a
woman with an enormous circle of friends. One doesn’t
want to be blatant,” said Nina, merely meaning that she
did not want to be thought so, “but do you suppose that one
day there isn’t bound to be some sort of record made—letters
or journals published——” She hesitated artistically,
as though implying an unlimited posthumous publicity
which might doubtless be insisted upon by the enormous
circle of friends, but of which modesty forbade her to speak.
Morris, always more or less hypnotized by the perfect assurance
which characterized his mother’s most outrageous
utterances, into believing them, made a violent mental effort,
and told himself that he was no longer a child.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, mother,” he untruly assured
her; “but I can tell you one thing, and that is, as far
as I am concerned, letters and everything else are invariably
destroyed.”</p>

<p>“I should never count upon your loyalty to my memory,
Morris,” said his mother sombrely.</p>

<p>A heavy silence prevailed.</p>

<p>Morris wondered vaguely, as he had often wondered before:
“What is it all about?”</p>

<p>There never seemed to be any definite reason for the state
of strain which existed between Mrs. Severing and her son,
nor for the crisis of anger and reproach to which that strain
was the inevitable prelude.</p>

<p>Morris could not see any definite reason why amicable
relations between them should ever be resumed, and yet he
knew that in the space of an hour, or less, it was quite possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
that the atmosphere would have changed, by degrees as
rapid as imperceptible, to one of complete sympathy.</p>

<p>That this forecast was in no way an exaggerated one was
amply demonstrated on this occasion.</p>

<p>After her withdrawal from the room in all the dignity of
grief and forgiveness—a withdrawal fraught for Morris
with hypothetical diary-writing—Nina suddenly sought her
son again in the course of that afternoon with every appearance
of affectionate confidence.</p>

<p>“Morris, I’m really worried about poor Bertie. Did I tell
you that I heard from her this morning? Frederick Tregaskis
is ill—a chill or something—and she doesn’t like to
leave him, and yet these convent people are writing to say
that Frances is in the infirmary, and giving no details whatever.
Simply say she’s very anæmic, and it may be what the
doctor calls ‘pernicious.’ Bertie is torn in two.”</p>

<p>Morris, who was relieved at his parent’s altered tone, felt
it due to her to reply with sympathetic concern, and even
added:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you go down to the convent yourself, and see
about Frances? They’d be sure to let <i>you</i> in, and then you
could relieve Mrs. Tregaskis’ mind.”</p>

<p>Nina looked pleased.</p>

<p>“I might do that. But really I don’t know whether their
rules and regulations would admit of a surprise visit. It’s
possible, too, that they mightn’t quite realize who one was,
as it is so long since I went there,” said Nina with gracious
humility, making it evident that Morris was not to be alone
in his concessions.</p>

<p>But the next day was a Saturday, and as neither of them
had ever had the faintest intention of proceeding to the convent,
it was in perfect harmony that Morris and his mother
motored down to Hurlingham for the afternoon.</p>

<p>On their return, Nina took up a small sheaf of letters in
her white-gloved hand.</p>

<p>“Bertie again!” she exclaimed lightly. “What an insatiable
letter-writer that dear woman is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>As she read the letter her face changed with that dramatic
suddenness of which Morris considered only himself to be
past master.</p>

<p>Contrary to his wont, however, he did not ignore his
mother’s only less admirable histrionic effort.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he inquired, in suitably sharpened accents
of apprehension.</p>

<p>Nina contrived to raise a face which had paled perceptibly,
an effect which Morris regretfully noted as being beyond his
compass.</p>

<p>“Poor little Frances! Bertha writes in the greatest terror
and distress. Those convent people have actually telegraphed
that she is very ill indeed, and in danger. Something
about the Last Sacraments. They don’t say anything
about wanting Bertie to go there, and in any case she’s not
able to leave Frederick. But Rosamund went down there
yesterday.”</p>

<p>Morris felt vaguely resentful. He disliked hearing of
anyone else’s grief or anxiety, and he thought his mother’s
agitation distinctly overdone.</p>

<p>“I hope she’s better by this time,” he said with reserve.</p>

<p>Nina turned slowly away, her hand pressed to her heart,
every symptom of distress emphasized in contrast to Morris’
obvious desire to be rid of the subject.</p>

<p>“This is a heavier blow to me than you can realize, my
poor boy,” she murmured in stricken accents. “It has been
mother and daughter between Frances and me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSAMUND, sick with anxiety, sat in the hideous
little convent parlour, waiting.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened, and Mrs. Mulholland
entered creakingly.</p>

<p>“Miss Grantham, isn’t it? Ah yes! I remember you
quite well at Sister Frances Mary’s Clothing—dear me, how
little we thought then—less than a year ago, wasn’t it, and
now—well, well! God’s Holy Will be done! But the very
day I learnt she was ill I said: ‘Ah dear, now, to think that
such a little while ago I saw her taking the habit,’ I said;
‘God’s ways are not our ways,’ I said.”</p>

<p>“When am I going to see her?” asked Rosamund with
white lips.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Mrs. Mulholland, shaking her head, and appearing
to think that she had given an adequate reply.</p>

<p>She sat down heavily.</p>

<p>“Now I want you to listen to me a moment, my dear
child. You don’t mind my calling you so? No—that’s
right. We’re all little children in the sight of God, is what I
always say, and I’m sure you feel like that too.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder if you know why I’ve been sent in here
to you?”</p>

<p>Rosamund shook her head dumbly. Mrs. Mulholland’s
words barely penetrated to her outer senses, and her mind
was tense with waiting for a summons that surely could no
longer delay.</p>

<p>“Well, our Assistant Superior, Mother Carolina, whom
you’ve seen already, sent for me, because she thought I
might be of a little help to you. She’s very busy, Mother
Carolina, very much distressed and grieved at our dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
Mother Pauline’s illness, though it’s nothing very serious,
thank God—and very much harassed and overworked with
all the responsibilities that have fallen on her shoulders.
But she found time to send for me, because she thought I
might be of more comfort to you, not being a nun, and you
being unused to convents and religious, than one of the community.
Now that,” said Mrs. Mulholland impressively,
“is what I call great delicacy of feeling. But that’s Mother
Carolina all over. Nothing if not thoughtful. ‘<i>C’est la
mère aux petits soins</i>,’ is what I always say about her.”</p>

<p>She looked at Rosamund’s white, inattentive face.</p>

<p>“You don’t quite understand our convent ways, do you?”
she said compassionately, “and of course that’s very natural.
But that’s why Mother Carolina thought you’d rather have
me to explain things to you than one of the nuns, though she
means to send the novice-mistress and the infirmarian to you
presently, so that you shall have the very latest news of our
dear little sufferer.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosamund gently. “It’s very kind. Thank
you. But I know you’ll understand that I don’t want to see
anybody except my sister just at present. Can you take me
to her?”</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, but Mrs. Mulholland did not move,
and her large old face became mottled and suffused with
pity.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear child, my dear child, you must be very
calm and brave and make a little sacrifice. You know it’s
quite against all convent regulations to let strangers into the
enclosure—quite unheard of. It can’t possibly be done.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Sister Frances Mary’s in her cell, dear—just where she
was when she was taken worse, they haven’t been able to
move her. You can’t possibly see her.”</p>

<p>Rosamund, with a pang that shook her physically from
head to foot, realized subconsciously that it was for this
that she had, in some strange way, been waiting.</p>

<p>“I can’t go to my own sister, who may be dying, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
wants me? I must go.” Her voice sounded utterly strange
to her own ears.</p>

<p>“Now—now—don’t take it like that, dear. It is very
hard, but that’s one of the sacrifices God asks of your dear
little sister in return for the great grace of her vocation, and
you must help her to make it generously. I know it’s hard
for you, and—— Where are you going, dear?”</p>

<p>“To find my sister.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland heaved herself out of her chair, pinioned
Rosamund by a kind but iron grip upon her arm, and began
again very earnestly:</p>

<p>“Now do listen to me, my dear child, and be reasonable.
You can’t break in upon the enclosure, you know, because,
apart from the fact that it would be a most wrong and sacrilegious
thing to do, nothing could possibly distress your
sister more. She’s joined the Order heart and soul, you
know, and it would be terrible to her to see its holy rules
broken on her behalf.”</p>

<p>“She wants me.”</p>

<p>“Naturally speaking, she wants you, perhaps, but grace is
stronger than nature, and she is living wholly and solely by
grace now, you must remember. Indeed,” said Mrs. Mulholland,
hoarsely and earnestly, “it would grieve her beyond
words to have a scene in the enclosure, and with Mère
Pauline ill as she is—it’s to be thought of, dear Miss Grantham.”</p>

<p>“But is she dying—is Frances dying?”</p>

<p>“That’s as God wills. Perhaps He will accept this sacrifice
of yours and spare her life, if He judges best, and if
not—the goal of the religious life is death.”</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at her wildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear child. What is the life of a religious on
earth but the seeking of a closer union with God? And how
can the consummation of that union be reached but through
death? A religious lives only to die.”</p>

<p>“Frances! Frances!”</p>

<p>“Now do cry as much as ever you like,” said Mrs. Mulholland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
in practical tones that contrasted oddly with the
fervour that still illuminated her coarse, plain old face. “It
will do you good. God knows very well that you can’t help
<i>feeling</i> your sacrifice, even though you make it with your
will. And He won’t give you more than you can bear.
Now, supposing we were to ask Him together to spare your
dear sister’s life, if that is best for her?”</p>

<p>Rosamund’s eyes dilated slowly.</p>

<p>“Can she want to live?” she half whispered.</p>

<p>“My dear, I am quite sure she wants only God’s Holy
Will, whatever that may be.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Rosamund, “you don’t understand. We’re
talking of different people, you and I. You’re talking of a
little prim, unnatural novice, dressed up, and doing a set of
actions by routine every day, and saying her set prayers and
phrases, and doing her work—and I—I’m talking of my
Francie, my little sister who lived at home with me when we
were in the Wye Valley, and played and laughed and was
happy with me. She <i>must</i> want to come home—she must.”</p>

<p>Rosamund’s voice held agony, and the shadows round her
mouth and under her great eyes were deepening until they
seemed carved upon her colourless face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland gazed at her uneasily and said:</p>

<p>“Now do cry, my dear, it will do you a lot of good, and
listen to me. I quite see that this is a most terrible trial for
you, and it all seems dreadful and unnatural that your little
sister should be leading this sort of life. But you know,
she’s chosen it all of her own free will, and I’m sure she’s
told you that she’s very happy with us, and only longing for
the day of her final vows.”</p>

<p>“It’s glamour—madness—an enthusiasm—it can’t
last.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t last if it were only an enthusiasm, as you say,
but you know God gives the grace to live up to a religious
vocation. Your little sister has had that grace, and so she’s
very happy. At first it’s all very difficult—the home-sickness,
and the obedience, and the hard life—but that’s just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
Nature. The flesh is weak, you know, though the spirit is
willing.”</p>

<p>“I thought she would come home with me now. I
thought I had come to fetch her, and that perhaps we should
go home together. When I heard she was ill, I thought it
was sure to mean that she would come away then, and give
it all up.”</p>

<p>“She could come away to-morrow if she wanted to.
Novices are not kept against their will. No, no, dear, your
sister’s vocation is a very real one. Tell me, you wish for
her happiness, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I wish for it so much that if I’d seen her happy and at
peace here I would not have said one word—not one, to
make her think I wanted her back. But I haven’t even seen
her—I’m only told that she’s very ill, and not allowed to go
to her. I <i>will</i> go—it’s wicked to keep me from her.”</p>

<p>“Now, now,” said Mrs. Mulholland soothingly.</p>

<p>The door opened softly.</p>

<p>“Here’s Mother Juliana. This poor child is nearly frantic,
Mother. She can’t understand not being allowed to go
to Sister Frances Mary, you see.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland looked almost pleadingly at the tall,
gentle old nun who had just entered.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Mother Juliana, in a strong, slow voice that
came oddly from her slight, bent figure with its habitual
stoop. “I have brought you a message, then, that will be
of comfort to you. Your sister is awake, and I said to her
that you would like a message, but I did not tell her you
were here—it was wiser not. She is very weak, <i>la pauvre</i>,
but she whispered so softly: ‘Tell her: My love, and I
am so happy.’”</p>

<p>“Thank God for all His mercies,” said Mrs. Mulholland
with a sort of matter-of-fact promptness. “Is she better?”</p>

<p>“I do not think her better,” said the nun quietly. “I
do not think she will get better in this world. God wants
her for Himself.”</p>

<p>Rosamund looked dumbly at them both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“She does not suffer,” gently said Mother Juliana with
the same faint, remote smile. “She is very quiet and peaceful—and,
as she said, so happy! She has the smile of a
little child, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“There, there,” said Mrs. Mulholland, unconscious of the
tears running down her face, “what did I tell you? Come
into the chapel, my dear, with me. You shall be quite quiet
there, and we mustn’t keep Mother Juliana. Is not the doctor
due now?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I came down to see mademoiselle first, but I must
return to my infirmary at once. I will come and tell you
what he has said, my child, but do not have false hopes.
God knows what is best.”</p>

<p>She turned and glided noiselessly out of the room. Her
whole demeanour was one of ageless, passionless aloofness.
She was very unlike Mère Pauline, quick, alert, human.</p>

<p>“Ah, I wish that Mère Pauline could have been here to
see you, my poor child,” cried Mrs. Mulholland, as though
involuntarily struck by the contrast. “But human comfort
can do very little for any of us. Now come with me, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>She took Rosamund’s hand as though she had been guiding
a child, and led her to the chapel door.</p>

<p>“Go in there,” she whispered huskily, pointing to the
half-open door. “I’ll come and fetch you when the doctor
has gone away again.”</p>

<p>Rosamund went in and heard the door swing to behind
her.</p>

<p>The chapel was very still and hushed in the afternoon sunlight.
A tiny purple patch danced and flickered over the
wall. Nothing else moved. As Rosamund’s eyes became
accustomed to the semi-gloom she saw that the figure of a
nun knelt upon an upright carved <i>prie-dieu</i> just in front of
the Sanctuary. The black veil and heavy habit hung in
motionless folds. It seemed as though nothing could, or
would, ever disturb that immovable contemplation again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>Rosamund knelt mechanically and remained on her knees,
thoughts seething without any conscious volition of her own
across the upper surface of her mind, and beneath, an abyss
of misery toward which she felt herself slowly, slowly slipping.
When the surface thoughts failed her, she knew subconsciously
that she must touch those yawning depths. She
wondered if the nun was praying. Making intercession,
perhaps, for the Superior whose illness had flung the community
into disarray—asking for the forgiveness of her
own half imaginary sins—involuntary infringements of
some convent regulation. Was she praying for those whom
she loved—those who had perchance been all the world
to her, before she chose to renounce all human ties and give
herself to God alone?</p>

<p>Rosamund slipped a little further towards the abyss with
the thought.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the woman kneeling there in her black
draperies had been a little child, living at home with a father
and mother, and no doubt other children—the children who
had played together—shared the countless associations of a
common childhood. Did the one who was a nun remember
still, or had it all become unreal to her? Was the only reality
her tranquil community life, with its loyalty to the Superior
to the Order, its forgetfulness of the things outside?</p>

<p>She had forgotten, perhaps. The children who had
played together at home, the mother who had perhaps gathered
them round her in the long summer evenings and called
them home from their outdoor play when the afternoons
grew short and dark, were all part of another life, to the
nun. Now if she were dying, her mother would not be
allowed to go to her....</p>

<p>Nearer—nearer still to that bottomless gulf.</p>

<p>If they came to see her, it would be “<i>un parloir</i>” for
our sister—the Superior would send her down as to a duty,
the time of her stay would be regulated. There is work to
be done—work for the community, for the glory of God.
Our sister cannot be spared for very long. But the Superior—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
Superior herself will come down to the waiting
mother and sister. They shall see the building—the
Chapel—the Superior will arrange that tea should be
brought to them in the parlour. And our sister is grateful—that
the Superior, with so much to do, so much to think
of, should yet spare some of her time and of her thought
for the anxious visitors waiting in the grim little parlour.</p>

<p><i>Why—ah, why?</i></p>

<p>The edge of the precipice is very near now.</p>

<p>The nun has made her sacrifice—she has given it all up—the
life in the world, the love in the world, the homely
affections and joys in the world. They say that she has
given it all to God. He wanted it then? He gave her all
those things only that she might give them back to Him—and
in return He gives her Himself.</p>

<p>They say so.</p>

<p><i>They told Francie that.</i></p>

<p>Francie has given everything: her innocent youth, the
old happy days with Rosamund, the days when they had
been little children together in the Wye Valley, the small
troubles and small enjoyments that had made up her life—all
merged now into one vast reality, one supreme sacrifice.</p>

<p>What was it the woman who had been kind had said in
the parlour? Death is the goal of the religious life.</p>

<p>If she died it would be all over. Over for Frances, the
long separation that the years would widen between her and
Rosamund; over, the aching sense of home-sickness that
surely the most detached of our sisters must know, the secret
wail of “Never more” that is now only a temptation to be
met and crushed. Over, the hard daily life—the monotonous
early rising, battling with sleep in the cold of the
chapel, the heavy day’s work, the inevitable recreation with
guard on tongue and senses, the struggle to fix a tired mind
on prayer or contemplation; over, the infinite tension, the
stretching towards an unattainable ideal—all over in death.</p>

<p>So near to the abyss now that no more clutching at
thoughts and memories can save her, Rosamund prays:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“Let her die. Let it all be over for her. Oh God, if
there is mercy and pity in You let Frances die now. She
has made the sacrifice—she was willing to give up everything
for You—let that be enough—let her die now.
Don’t let her come back to it all. If she dies now, it will be
all over. She will be with You in Heaven perhaps, or else
it will just be nothing—all over. That would be best—oh,
that would be best. Never to know or feel anything any
more—to be at rest.</p>

<p>“Let my Francie die now. I don’t even ask to see her
again—it would break her heart to see me like this; let her
only remember me as in the old days when we were together—she
and I—as we shall never, never be any more.”</p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p>The sense of irrevocability has suddenly become
poignant and unbearable. There is no going back. There
is no solution.</p>

<p>And with that certainty comes the last failing clutch at
the sense of proportion which lies at the back of sanity—and
then the abyss.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Poor child, poor child,” sobbed Mrs. Mulholland noisily
outside the door. “Shall I bring her to you, Mother dear?”</p>

<p>“Bring her to the little parlour.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland creaked into the chapel, mopping at her
eyes resolutely with a large handkerchief, and sank heavily
on to her knees beside the bench where Rosamund was half
kneeling and half crouching.</p>

<p>“Mother Juliana wants you in the little parlour, my dear.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>Rosamund came. Her hands moved with a helpless, groping
gesture, and her face, stained and ravaged, was blank
of expression.</p>

<p>“My dear, God’s Holy Will be done, is what I say,” said
the old woman beside her, moving along the stone passage
with a step that seemed more ponderous than usual.</p>

<p>“You’ve been making your act of resignation too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
haven’t you, poor child—I know it. Come in to Mother
Juliana.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland was crying openly, but Mother Juliana
faced Rosamund with the fixed, remote gaze of one whose
standard of values is set elsewhere.</p>

<p>“God is going to ask a gift from you,” she said quietly to
Rosamund.</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at her with the dilated eyes of a child
that cannot understand what is said to it.</p>

<p>“There is only one solution,” she muttered in an inward
voice.</p>

<p>It was the only conviction that remained to her from out
of chaos, and she held to it as to the last link with sanity.</p>

<p>“There is only one solution. I had to pray for that.”</p>

<p>“God holds all solutions in His own hands,” said the
nun. “Your beloved little sister has done her work for
Him on earth, and He has taken her to Himself.”</p>

<p>“Is Francie dead?” asked Rosamund in that gentle inward
voice.</p>

<p>“Our Lord called her to Heaven, in her sleep, and she
went so quietly. She is with Him, dear child.”</p>

<p>“She is dead,” repeated Rosamund. “I prayed for
Francie to die and she’s dead—thank God—oh!”—her
voice choked in her throat—“I’m thanking God that
<i>Francie</i> is dead——”</p>

<p>The darkness closed round her and she touched the depths—the
very depths—of the abyss.</p>

<p>And because those depths are deeper than we can plumb
with our frail strength, a merciful unconsciousness was
vouchsafed to Rosamund even as she reached them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSAMUND lay in the tiny convent infirmary where
she had been for a week.</p>

<p>She was quite weak, and the tears that had not
come to her before streamed irrepressibly now. She could
not stop crying.</p>

<p>They told her of the little novice, Sister Frances Mary,
lying in her white habit with her hands folded against her
breast, a crucifix between them, and wearing the chaplet
of white artificial flowers which she had worn at her <i>prise
d’habit</i>, and with which the nuns had garlanded her now over
the white veil.</p>

<p>And Rosamund, the tears pouring down her face, saw
only a little girl with soft, flying hair, in a pink sunbonnet,
swinging in the orchard above the Wye Valley.</p>

<p>The infirmarian told her of Mère Pauline’s recovery, and
of how, still weak and shaken, she had knelt, <i>toute tremblante,
pauvre Mère</i>, in the chapel where they had placed her
child, and prayed beside the black-draped oaken trestles
where lay the mortal remains of Sister Frances Mary.</p>

<p>Rosamund had heard the tolling chapel bell, and Mother
Juliana had read her the prayers that had been offered in
the hillside cemetery beyond the town, where they had laid
Sister Frances Mary. And she had seen another hill, and
heard only the sound of two little sisters calling to one another
in their play.</p>

<p>The nuns did not understand. They had only known Sister
Frances Mary.</p>

<p>They were very kind to her, and the infirmarian daily
brought her messages from the Superior, promises of an
early visit, and assurances that she was not to think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
leaving the convent until <i>le médecin</i> had declared her to be
<i>remise du coup</i>.</p>

<p>Rosamund remained passive. The tears that she could
not restrain did not matter here, and they kept her from
the lowest of those abysmal depths that she had sounded
before something snapped within her, and she had felt herself
falling helplessly, in the convent parlour, with Mrs. Mulholland’s
large, frightened old face wavering strangely before
her eyes.</p>

<p>Since then, unutterable weariness and yet unutterable
relief had taken possession of her. Frances was dead, and
Frances was hers again as in the days when they had been
children together, and seen all life before them in an illimitable
perspective. Of Porthlew, she thought hardly at all.
Her mind had gone back to the Wye Valley days. Old
formulæ that had passed between the two, long since forgotten,
little trivial memories that had been common to
them both, thronged to Rosamund’s mind almost involuntarily
in her weakness, and the finality held by Death seemed
the only refuge from the far more poignant finality that life
had offered.</p>

<p>In the curious need of dependence which utter physical
and mental lassitude induces, Rosamund, scarcely conscious
of even a vague surprise, found that she had turned to Mrs.
Mulholland.</p>

<p>The old woman toiled heavily up the narrow stairs that
led to the infirmary, and spent the spring afternoons sitting
by the window in the tiny room, with her work held close
to her spectacles, while she talked with her odd matter-of-fact
piety to Rosamund, or listened to her few replies and
questions.</p>

<p>One day she brought her some flowers, and Rosamund
sobbed and cried over them, and tried to tell Mrs. Mulholland
why, and could not.</p>

<p>“Now, my poor dear child, don’t try to talk about it. The
fact is you’re still very weak, and the least thing oversets
you. But you must remember that your dear little sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
has much better flowers to look at where she is now than
any this poor old earth can offer. Eye hath not seen——”
said Mrs. Mulholland, shaking her head. “I often think if
this earth is so beautiful with flowers and everything, why,
what must Heaven be?”</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at her.</p>

<p>“Violets <i>all</i> the year round, most probably,” pursued the
old lady cheerfully, “though, to be sure, it’s absurd to talk
of all the year round in eternity—but one always thinks
of it as being spring or summer in Heaven. But whatever
it is, my dear, you may depend upon it that your sister is
seeing all the wonderful things that have been promised to
those who forsake everything for God.”</p>

<p>“Can she be happy if she knows that I am still here?”
asked Rosamund wistfully.</p>

<p>“Happy in the Will of God. And I am sure that time
seems only a flash to her, though to us it feels so long, and
then you’ll be with her and can enjoy it all together. And
then, you know, it will be for eternity, and there will be no
more parting,” said Mrs. Mulholland earnestly.</p>

<p>“It will be just like it used to be, and all the years in
between will be forgotten,” sobbed Rosamund.</p>

<p>“That’s it, my dear. Now doesn’t the thought of that
meeting give you courage?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. It isn’t as real to me as it is to you.”</p>

<p>“Brought up without very much religion, perhaps,”
acquiesced Mrs. Mulholland cheerfully. “Well, well, your
dear little sister will do wonders for you. A vocation in a
family is a very great grace, and certainly she had done all
our Lord wanted of her on earth, and that’s why He took
her to Himself in Heaven.”</p>

<p>The Heaven, beautiful, material, and yet fadeless and endless,
presented thus to her brought a strange weary comfort
to Rosamund’s mind.</p>

<p>“We shall be together again, and it will be just like before
she went away—only better,” she repeated, like a child.</p>

<p>“Yes—much, much better. Nothing to end it, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
God’s holy presence, you know. It will all be merged in
that.”</p>

<p>“And the people we’ve loved on earth?” urged Rosamund,
as though she needed reassurance from her companion’s
robust certainties.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, all of them. We may have to wait a little
while for some, you know, because they’ve purgatory to go
through—and so have we for the matter of that—but Sister
Frances is safe enough, my dear. Nuns have their
purgatory on earth, is what I always say. And a little pure
soul like that—why, she’s waiting up there now, for you,
I expect. I shall get there before you, my dear, please God,
and you may be quite sure I shall give you better prayers
there than I can here.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to die, Mrs. Mulholland?”</p>

<p>“Only when God pleases, my dear. A year or two more
or less won’t make very much difference, except that it gives
one more time to try and get ready. But of course I look
forward to getting to Heaven—naturally I do.”</p>

<p>“And do you think you will find the people you love
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, yes,” Mrs. Mulholland patiently reiterated.
“I often think how very strange it will be to meet Michael
again—that’s my husband, who died more than forty years
ago, after we’d been married five years. A very bad husband
he was to me—I married a non-practising Catholic,
my dear, and a terrible mistake it was, too—but thank
God he made a very good confession at the last, and died in
a state of grace. But of course he must be very much
changed, since he was just a bad man when I knew him—neither
more nor less—except for that little while at the
end. But with all the prayers and the Masses that have
been offered, and God’s good mercy, I can’t help hoping that
poor Michael is a blessed spirit in Heaven by this time.”</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and Rosamund thought that her
lips moved as in some intercession that had grown habitual
through long use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>“I’ve had a lot of trouble, my dear—always have had—and
but for the Faith I should be an unhappy old woman.
But look at what God has done for me,” cried Mrs. Mulholland
triumphantly; “brought me here, to the convent,
with all these good nuns, so that I shall probably end my
days amongst them, and get all their prayers to shorten my
time in purgatory. Nearly twenty years I’ve been here,
my dear, and my position quite established, I assure you.
I live by rule, you know, though I’m not a nun—follow the
office, have my own little corner in the chapel—and then
the Superior likes me to keep an eye on the lady boarders.
‘<i>La mère des dames pensionnaires</i>’ the lay-sisters call me.
I look after them, you know. ‘Come to me if you want anything,’
is what I always tell them. ‘The nuns are very busy—spare
them all we can. Come to me instead,’ I always
say. ‘If I can’t help you, well and good, I’ll refer you to
the proper quarter,’ says I, ‘but come to me first.’ That
spares the nuns a little, and I generally find that trifling difficulties
can be put right without troubling them. <i>That’s</i> the
advantage of my position here.”</p>

<p>Rosamund listened passively. She liked Mrs. Mulholland
to talk. Her deep, rather hoarse voice seemed to make a
link between reality and that abyss into which one had fallen,
where nothing was real or solid but thick tangible darkness
and endless despairing pain. While Mrs. Mulholland went
on talking, it was as though a faint ray of light filtered down,
reminding one that above the abyss there still lay solid
ground with the sky overhead.</p>

<p>Then, very slowly, Rosamund realized that she had left
the worst depths behind her. Never again would she know
the blighting, searing agony of those first moments, and
never again would she be as though she had not known them.</p>

<p>The initiation which life holds for most of us varies as
strangely in its character as does the intensity of its effect
upon us.</p>

<p>Rosamund said to Mrs. Mulholland one day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“I feel as though this was the first time I’d ever felt anything—as
though other things in my life had been only a
sort of pretence. And yet they weren’t. My mother’s
death, when I was a little girl, and leaving home, and other
things—which happened at Porthlew—I minded them all.
I fell in love with somebody, and thought that must be the
realest thing in the word. And it made me very unhappy—it
really did.”</p>

<p>She looked at Mrs. Mulholland, not expecting her to
offer any solution, but feeling a sort of weary solace in putting
her confused thoughts into words.</p>

<p>“But, you know, it doesn’t seem at all real now. It never
touched bedrock. In a sort of way—<i>I</i> brought unhappiness
to <i>it</i>—not it to me.”</p>

<p>“It’s very often so, my dear,” said Mrs. Mulholland
placidly. “Sometimes we need a very sharp lesson to take
us out of ourselves. That’s where God’s wisdom is so far
above ours. He sees what we need, and orders all things
for the best. The loss of your dear sister will bring you
nearer to God.”</p>

<p>The words might hold a simple direct interpretation for
Mrs. Mulholland that could never be Rosamund’s, but their
truth was destined to abide with her in an ever expanding
certainty.</p>

<p>“You are very, very kind to me,” she said wistfully;
“everyone is.”</p>

<p>“You’re one of us, as Sister Frances Mary’s sister. The
convent tie is a very real one, you know, though people in
the world like to think it’s not. But you have a number of
friends, my dear, outside, as well as here. I have a lot of
letters for you, only Mother Juliana suggested that you
might be better without them just at first. Would you like
them now?”</p>

<p>Rosamund took the little sheaf gently.</p>

<p>The writers seemed strangely remote to her, but she read
with a faint stirring of gratitude her guardian’s long letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>Bertha offered to come to her, would have done so instantly,
but for the illness of Cousin Frederick, who, they
terribly feared, was threatened with pneumonia.</p>

<p>“But come to me as soon as you are able to, dearest child.
I feel torn in two, as you can imagine, and only wish I
could be in both places at once. If poor Minnie would be of
any comfort, telegraph to me and I’ll send her. I can easily
manage the sitting up at nights for a time; anyhow, if this
is going to be the long illness the doctor fears, we shall have
to get a trained nurse. Remember there’s <i>home</i> waiting for
you, my Rosamund, and an old woman who’s been through
a good deal herself one way and another, and only longs to
help and comfort you. One finds out, as one goes along,
that nothing matters except to lend a hand.”</p>

<p>“I ought to go back,” said Rosamund. “I am quite well
now. But I don’t know what my life is going to be.
Porthlew doesn’t seem to be right for me, somehow. It
never did—and I thought that Francie and I would go back
to the Wye Valley together. The cottage is ours.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t look too far ahead,” urged Mrs. Mulholland.
“One step at a time, is what I always say.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘Lord, for to-morrow and its needs I do not pray,</div>
<div class="verse">But help me, teach me, guide me, Lord, just for to-day.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>Have you never heard that before? Dear me, dear me,
I don’t believe you Protestant girls are ever taught anything
at all. Excuse me for saying so, my dear, but really it’s
true. Now before you settle anything I should like you to
have a good talk with Mère Pauline.”</p>

<p>The Superior saw Rosamund in the parlour, but the understanding
which she was ready to extend as to one of her
own daughters in religion, failed oddly to touch any responsive chord.
It was as though the two spoke different languages.</p>

<p>Rosamund did not want to talk with the convent chaplain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
as Mère Pauline suggested, and felt merely a faint distaste
at the suggestion that “<i>cette épreuve</i>” might be meant to
guide her into the way of the true Faith.</p>

<p>Mère Pauline did not pursue the subject, but she appeared
uneasy at Rosamund’s listless suggestion of returning to
Porthlew.</p>

<p>“Je n’aime pas cette atmosphère-là,” she remarked with
an air of omniscience that sat oddly on her little spectacled
countenance.</p>

<p>The direct act of God therefore appeared to Mère Pauline
solely responsible for the next letter from Mrs. Tregaskis,
which again altered Rosamund’s plans.</p>

<p>Frederick Tregaskis was very ill with pneumonia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I don’t leave him day or night,” wrote Bertha, “and the
house would be utterly dreary for you just now. Stay on
at the convent, my dear, if you’re finding peace and shelter
there, and when I’ve battled through the worst of this we
must look forward to meeting. It’s a sad world, Rosamund,
my dear, but there’s nothing for it but to keep a stiff upper
lip. I’ll write when I can.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">“Your ever loving old</span><br>
“B. H. T.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Poor Cousin Bertie,” said Rosamund.</p>

<p>“<i>Il faut prier</i>,” said Mère Pauline. “But you, my child.
Will you stay on with us, as one of our lady boarders?”</p>

<p>“If there were some work that I might do—it is so difficult
to do nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will reflect. A good Catholic family life is the
atmosphere that I should wish for you at present, poor little
one. But I will reflect.”</p>

<p>That Mère Pauline’s reflections were apt to take a practical
turn was demonstrated three days later by a letter from
Lady Argent begging Rosamund to come to her.</p>

<p>She wrote that she was alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>So Rosamund went back to the Wye Valley.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my dear child,” said Mrs. Mulholland
heartily. “Come back and see us again, and don’t forget
that there’s God’s good purpose behind everything, whether
we can see it or not.”</p>

<p>“Will there be some sort of definite solution to it all, in
time?” Rosamund asked.</p>

<p>She had come to have a curious reliance on Mrs. Mulholland’s
opinionative statements.</p>

<p>“To be sure, my dear. You haven’t been through all this
for nothing, you know,” said Mrs. Mulholland, shaking her
head wisely. “Now I’m going into the garden to say my
office, and you know that I shall always give you and dear
little Sister Frances a special intention. I’ve put you in
together.”</p>

<p>She kissed Rosamund warmly, then kilted her skirts in
her accustomed fashion and took her old black manuals out
into the spring sunshine and began her slow, steady pounding
walk round and round the small enclosure.</p>

<p>The years would see little change for Mrs. Mulholland,
until that last one which she contemplated with such matter-of-fact
anticipation.</p>

<p>Something in that certainty sent Rosamund away with a
strange lessening of the tension at her heart.</p>

<p>She went back to the Wye Valley, and after a little while
she went across to the cottage.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Rosamund thought that it was on that day
that she received the first hint of the solution that she had
been seeking. But at the time she was conscious only of a
blurred, aching pain, that yet held the strange solemnity of
final peace.</p>

<p>The spring rain was driving against the window-panes
and the outlines of the hills were dimmed.</p>

<p>Rosamund wept wildly and uncontrollably, but after that
afternoon she bade farewell to the stormy tears of her girlhood,
and they came to her no more.</p>

<p>There is a certain sort of weeping that, when it has once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
been wrung from a woman’s eyes, precludes the easy relief
of trivial tears for almost all the rest of her life.</p>

<p>Rosamund went over the small house and found it
strangely unchanged. Through it all, the sense of coming
home was strong upon her.</p>

<p>“I could come back and live there very soon, couldn’t I?”
she asked that same evening of Lady Argent. “You know
I always meant to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and one knows that if that poor dear little
angel had been spared to us, you could have gone there together,
except, of course, that it was perfectly obvious from
the very beginning that she had a true religious vocation,
and couldn’t have been anywhere but where she was. But
girls can do almost anything nowadays, and I’ve no doubt
that you could find some very suitable person to live with
you, since you’re of age, and have your own money; and then
you know, my dear, you’re sure to marry. But I quite see
that what you want now is just the quiet of it all, and then
being fond of the place and everything. Only if you won’t
mind my asking, and, indeed, dear, you know it’s not from
curiosity, are you quite sure that you don’t want to go back
to Porthlew?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know how good Cousin Bertie’s been, but indeed
I don’t see any object in our living together. I worried
her dreadfully when I was there, and it was quite
decided that when I came of age some other arrangement
would be made. You know, she has such hundreds of interests—all
her work and her charities and everything—and
Miss Blandflower gives her all the help she ever wants.
I don’t think I was much use there, ever.”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“I know it sounds as though I were ungrateful,” said
Rosamund desperately, “but I’m trying so hard to get at
the truth of things. I don’t feel a bit that my place is at
Porthlew—I don’t know where it is. I want to come home—but
I don’t feel even that to be a solution.”</p>

<p>“Poor child! If only you and dear Bertie——” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Lady Argent helplessly. “But I know what that sort of
thing is—so hopeless, I always think, when two people are
both willing and ready and tolerant as can be, and yet they
don’t seem able to understand one another. And, of course,
as you say, Bertie always has her hands full, and I know
that very capable people don’t much like being helped—I
shall never forget poor Fergus—my husband, you know,
dear—over his telescope and things, even when one only
wanted to clean the lenses or some tiny little thing like that.
But that was only one thing, and he was quite ready to ask
for help about anything else. At least, almost anything
else.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent’s expression became rather pensively
reminiscent.</p>

<p>Rosamund remained vaguely wondering.</p>

<p>She felt during those days in the Wye Valley as though
she were seeking for a conviction, latent in her mind, but
that yet delayed formation and continued to evade consciousness.
Once grasped, she would be in touch with reality and
in some strange way closer to Frances.</p>

<p>She questioned herself helplessly.</p>

<p>“Am I sincere? Is my place really back at Porthlew,
with Cousin Bertie? Is it perhaps an easy evasion to say
that I am of no use to her? She gave us a home when
mother died, and she has lost Hazel. Frances left her—there
is only me now. Self-sacrifice—is that the key?
But it all seems useless—pointless.”</p>

<p>She remained, seeking the solution.</p>

<p>Even when the hand of circumstance flung her against it,
it still failed to awaken her inner certainties.</p>

<p>Frederick Tregaskis died of pneumonia within a fortnight.</p>

<p>Rosamund made her preparations for a hurried departure,
and found time to return once more to the cottage on the hill.</p>

<p>“Is it good-bye again?” she asked dumbly of her surroundings.
“Certainly there is no doubt now that I have
to go to Porthlew again. The solution has come, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>She felt oddly disconcerted and at variance with herself.</p>

<p>At all events, there was more sense of blankness than of
acute bitterness in her farewell to the cottage. The renunciation,
if renunciation there was, remained strangely
devoid of pain.</p>

<p>She reflected dimly that all that for which the cottage in
the Wye Valley stood was hers still, and would remain hers,
and in the days at Porthlew which followed, when Bertha
frankly outfaced bitterness and loss with a courage that did
not shrink from reference to their divided sorrows, Rosamund
told herself passionately that to her, and her alone,
belonged the deepest memory of Frances.</p>

<p>Since her solution was to come from within, and not from
without, it was almost with the sense of puzzled acceptance
that is brought to an anticipated situation, that she heard
Bertha’s decision to leave Porthlew.</p>

<p>“The house is too big for me, alone with poor old Minnie,
and for the matter of that I simply can’t afford it now. My
dear old man’s pension went with him, and has made a big
hole in the exchequer. Besides, I don’t know that I could
altogether stand it. No, no, some rich American shall buy
Porthlew. Hazel doesn’t want it now, and there’s no one
to make a home for. One must just strike fresh roots
somewhere, that’s all, and hope for work. It’s the only
thing, Rosamund, my dear, for an old woman left by herself.
Find a lame dog that wants helping over stiles.”</p>

<p>But both Rosamund and Bertha were sufficiently awake
to the obvious course for it to come to life between them
without even any very definite suggestion or discussion.</p>

<p>“Could I leave Cornwall?” said Bertha wistfully. “I
be a Carnish woman thrü and thrü, ma dear.”</p>

<p>It was Rosamund’s need of Bertha that clinched it. Rosamund,
strangely, felt it to exist, and the sincerity of her
urgency broke down Bertha’s indifferent defences. The
deepest craving that Mrs. Tregaskis knew was that of being
needed, and for that she left Cornwall and went with Rosamund
to the Wye Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>It was there, with her halved memories and strangely
shared sanctities, that Rosamund’s quest suddenly and consciously
came to an end.</p>

<p>In the last and most subtle renunciation, she found the
solution to which that final relinquishment held the only
key, and at the same time the one enduring link that was to
bring her nearest to Frances.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“SO you came here, my dear—after all?”</p>

<p>“After all, Nina. That just expresses the whole
thing. Poor little Rosamund had to go through the
mill, and learn her own lesson, and then after it was all over—well,
she just wanted me—and there it was!”</p>

<p>“You were there when she wanted you.”</p>

<p>Bertha laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Well—one is, somehow. The generation that gives
and the generation that takes. I suppose one <i>took</i> once
upon a time, oneself, and this keeps the balance true.”</p>

<p>“And your Minnie followed you, so you’re not alone?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! Dear Minnie! She’s played ivy to my oak-tree
for so long that it’s impossible to imagine her without
a prop. I’m glad to have her, and then Rosamund need
never feel in any least little way bound—I’m renting this
tiny place from her, you know. It’s quite a business arrangement.”</p>

<p>“So much the best way to do things, though, as you
know, dearest, I’m so dreadfully silly about practical things
like rent and ground taxes and technical terms like that.
So you can really feel it’s your own little domain?”</p>

<p>“For the time being. Anything else would have been
rather an anomaly, don’t you think? Rosamund has a great
attachment to the place—always wanted to come back here—and
then it’s full of associations of her childhood and
little Francie’s. I know exactly what she feels about it.”</p>

<p>Bertha’s softened expression of full understanding gave
weight to the words.</p>

<p>“So Rosamund’s found herself,” said Mrs. Severing
musingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, poor dear, through coming into contact with reality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Oh, Nina, one would give anything to teach them some other
way—with less pain and fewer tears. But they won’t
listen. <i>Ah! si jeunesse savait!</i>”</p>

<p>“Dear Bertie! I understand—and don’t think that I
should ever think <i>you</i> egotistical and adding ‘<i>si vieillesse
pouvait</i>!’” softly said Mrs. Severing, freely sacrificing her
reluctance to display an indifferent French accent to the
satisfaction of laying a delicate emphasis on the pronoun
relating to her friend.</p>

<p>“You’ve felt it all, just as I have, Nina, that’s why
I can speak to you so freely,” returned Bertha smiling.</p>

<p>“Darling Bertie! I wish I could give you longer, but
you know how tiresome people are, and Gwen Cotton is
so dreadfully exacting. <i>Wretched</i> if I don’t stay there
whenever I’m anywhere near the place, and never allowing
me out of her sight when I get there. It really is absurd—a
perfect infatuation—nobody can think why. It always
makes me laugh.”</p>

<p>“How dear of you not to mind! That sort of thing,
making one look so absolutely ridiculous, always makes <i>me</i>
angry,” said Bertha serenely. “Is Morris there too?”</p>

<p>“He joins me to-morrow. I want him to come over and
see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Tregaskis meditatively. “Yes.”</p>

<p>So Morris came, and in his blue, direct gaze Rosamund
read a sympathy that he was later on to express in words.</p>

<p>Together in the garden, on an afternoon that reminded
them both oddly of another afternoon spent together in
the garden at Porthlew, they stood and looked over the
valley.</p>

<p>“May I say something?” asked Morris suddenly and
gently.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“In spite of everything, you are happier here than at
Porthlew, aren’t you? I mean—it’s your right place, so to
speak—this valley, and your own home and everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you and Mrs. Tregaskis understand one another
now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosamund simply and seriously. “Cousin
Bertie is an extraordinarily brave person, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“I think she is. And she’s a wonderfully understanding
one, too. I’m glad, Rosamund. I couldn’t bear to think
of you in an uncongenial atmosphere now.”</p>

<p>Rosamund, to whom it sometimes seemed that the understanding
of Mrs. Tregaskis was hardest of all to bear, said
nothing. The reticencies, the very reserves, which denoted
Bertha’s penetration into the deepest joys and sorrows that
Rosamund knew, lashed at her sensitiveness as no lesser
sympathy or more shallow insight could ever have done.</p>

<p>Ludovic Argent, again an onlooker, slowly guessed at
a little of it. He wondered whether Morris Severing, in love
with Rosamund, would understand. He felt a curious certainty
that on that understanding would depend her answer
to the inevitable question.</p>

<p>But Rosamund’s answer, when Morris asked her to marry
him, was in no way cryptic.</p>

<p>“I can’t, Morris. It’s out of the question. And, anyway,
I shouldn’t be any good to you.”</p>

<p>“Dearest, you would be everything in the world. Tell
me why....”</p>

<p>“For one thing, I don’t love you. No, Morris—I
<i>don’t</i>. If I did—there wouldn’t be anything more to be
said——”</p>

<p>“Indeed there would,” interjected her suitor with a sort
of boyish blitheness, “and I’d jolly well hear you say it,
too.”</p>

<p>“It’s no good my playing at things any more,” said Rosamund,
frowning a little as she sought for her words. “I
don’t mean because I feel superior or anything ridiculous
of that sort—but simply because it doesn’t amuse me any
longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>“I don’t want it to amuse you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t do it with any conviction, if you like
that better.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you do it with conviction or not, sweetheart—I’ll
convince you afterwards,” said Morris, his eyes
smiling at her after their endearing wont.</p>

<p>“No you couldn’t, Morris. Not the real part of me—the
only part that matters to either of us, in the least.”</p>

<p>Morris asked her to marry him again and again, and
Rosamund marvelled at her own indifference, was thrilled
and shaken by his pleading, and yet refused him with a
weary certainty of being true to a standard which, once
seen, she must hold to.</p>

<p>The last time that she said she could not marry him
finally brought conviction to Morris.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>do</i> leave me,” she cried. “I’m so tired, and it’s
all no use. There’s more than one sort of love in the world,
Morris, and your sort and my sort aren’t meant for one
another.”</p>

<p>“I could show you that they are, if——”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Rosamund with a sort of weary candour,
“I don’t want you to. I’m too tired, mentally, for any
more violent emotions, Morris. Honestly, I don’t believe
the capacity is in me any more.”</p>

<p>“If you fell in love, Rosamund.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Morris!” said Rosamund, half impatiently and
half in fatigue, “there are more ways of loving than falling
in love.”</p>

<p>Morris turned away despairingly and left her, carrying
with him the unescapable conviction that Rosamund had no
need of him.</p>

<p>Definitely unattainable, she became to him more desirable
than ever before, and it was of hardly any consolation to him
that Nina, in the deepest confidence, hinted at the tragedy
obscuring his life, both to her hostess and to as many of her
hostess’ friends as appeared sympathetic.</p>

<p>“My poor boy!” she said softly, and Morris divined that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
despair had imparted a ravaged appearance to his handsome
young face.</p>

<p>“I have only cared for one woman in my life,” he told
himself, not without some naïve feeling of surprise at the
discovery. “First and last, it’s been Rosamund. <i>On
revient toujours à son premier amour.</i>”</p>

<p>The aphorism was so pathetic that he repeated it next
day to Nina, who was evidently disposed for the rôle of
adoring mother, sympathizing blindly with her boy’s wrongs.</p>

<p>“I can’t forgive that girl!” she cried, with all the feminine
unreason of fiction, and a blaze in her great eyes that was
distinctly creditable in view of the fact that she so seldom
called it into play.</p>

<p>“No,” said Morris magnanimously, “I’m not worthy of
her, mother. It’s all right—only I can’t let you blame
her.”</p>

<p>“How can I help it, darling?” tenderly asked Nina.
“My heart is breaking for you.”</p>

<p>Morris, who was inclined to suppose that a monopoly of
broken hearts was his, at least for the time being, could
do no less than turn away with a stifled groan, indicating
a heartbreak beside which Nina’s could not hope to
rank.</p>

<p>It might have been Mrs. Severing’s perception of this
which caused her to remark with some decision:</p>

<p>“You will never, never know, Morris, till you have children
of your own, what it is to see them suffer. It is all so
infinitely more bitter than any grief of one’s own—but the
young don’t know—they don’t know.”</p>

<p>She broke off with one of those smiles which are sadder
than tears—an impression which Mrs. Severing could at
all times convey with great accuracy.</p>

<p>“My youth is over,” said Morris with profound bitterness.
Rather to his surprise, Nina repressed the obvious
retort, and contented herself with a faint sigh, expressing
many things.</p>

<p>Morris felt encouraged to a further display of feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>“I must get out of this place, mother,” he declared with
an abandon of recklessness that almost turned the luxurious
Towers into a medieval dungeon with every drawbridge up
and guarded.</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling.”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t quite stand being so near <i>her</i>,” groaned
Morris.</p>

<p>“We’ll go home again to-morrow,” soothingly declared
Nina, who was tired of Lady Cotton’s unappreciative adulation
and also hated being asked to “give a little music”
every evening after dinner.</p>

<p>“Mother! <i>how</i> you understand!” cried Morris in a sudden
rush of gratitude.</p>

<p>Nina looked at her son with liquid eyes.</p>

<p>He let her take his hand for a moment, gave hers a
squeeze that drove the stones of her rings into her fingers,
and dashed out of the room.</p>

<p>Nina unavoidably devoted an intense second or two to
the absorbing pain in her fingers, but did so, as it were, in
parenthesis. At the earliest possible moment she had recovered
herself, and was murmuring softly: “My little
son!” She saw Morris as a baby boy again, and at the
same time clearly visualized her present self indulging in
this tender illusion.</p>

<p>“Such a <i>little</i> boy,” murmured Nina again, her uninjured
hand hovering with a touching, instinctive sort of gesture
about two feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The same rapt look of retrospective tenderness tinged and
irradiated Mrs. Severing’s rather elusive and sketchy explanations
of her hostess and carried her serenely past the
loud and affectionate reproaches that assailed her up to the
very moment of farewell.</p>

<p>“I hate to leave you,” she sighed, “but you must come
and see my Cornish home one day—<i>soon</i>.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the little car, swathed in the most becoming
of amber coloured veils, and remarked to Morris almost
as they left the hall-door:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“Not that anything would ever induce me to have either
of them inside my house.”</p>

<p>Her matter-of-fact tone caused Morris to break into
an irrepressible laugh, and after an instant she joined him.
For a moment they enjoyed a delightful sense of companionship.
But Morris speedily resumed his dejection, and even
added to it a dash of recklessness that caused him to sit back
as far as possible in the driving-seat and disregard the speed
limit and his mother’s protests alike.</p>

<p>“Morris,” said Mrs. Severing bitterly, when the car had
apparently spun round a sharp corner on one wheel, “do you
ever think of anyone’s wishes but your own? I do all I can
to please you—cut short a visit which I am enjoying, at
the risk of hurting a great friend, come home with you
simply because you wish it—and you can’t even do such a
small thing as drive a little bit carefully when I beg you to.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” muttered Morris, in the tone
of a desperado outfacing death.</p>

<p>“Only that it’s very bad form to be a road-hog,” suavely
said Nina.</p>

<p>The shot told, for Morris was exceedingly proud of his
driving, but discretion was never Mrs. Severing’s strongest
weapon, and she added rashly:</p>

<p>“How little you know what it is to be highly strung, my
poor Morris! My nerves have been a misery to me all my
life long, and even if I’ve never said very much about it,
that doesn’t mean I don’t suffer. No one can look at me,”
said Nina with emotion, “and think me a strong woman.”</p>

<p>“Lady Cotton and Mrs. Tregaskis both told me they’d
never seen you looking better,” said Morris viciously.</p>

<p>Nina’s slight laugh was compounded of annoyance and
of a rather satirical compassion for the blindness of the
authorities quoted.</p>

<p>“Dear Gwen! She always loves to say that I look better
after staying with her. As for Bertie, she’s such a tower
of strength herself, that I rather fancy nothing short of a
broken leg would ever attract her attention. I’ve heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
other people say the same thing about her too, dear, kind
thing though she is.”</p>

<p>But Morris was annoyed.</p>

<p>“Well, I quite agree with them both,” he remarked disagreeably.
“I’ve never seen you look better, mother—the
picture of health.”</p>

<p>His mother smiled the pitying smile of one better informed,
and Morris, subconsciously aware of it, gazed
straight ahead of him with absorbed determination.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid what I call my best would be a very poor
state of health for most people,” murmured Nina, and added
hurriedly: “Don’t talk to me any more, Morris, I want to
close my eyes. I had a very nearly sleepless night.”</p>

<p>Morris was not minded to concede to his parent the
feminine privilege of the last word.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you must be much stronger than you suppose,
mother, if you can sleep when you’re nervous.”</p>

<p>On this encouraging reflection he drove the car with great
and unnecessary rapidity to the junction where the chauffeur
met him and took charge of it, while Morris and his mother
proceeded to Cornwall by train.</p>

<p>The journey was made by Morris in a smoking carriage,
with the considerate remark: “Do finish your doze in
peace, mother. I want to smoke, and besides, I wouldn’t
disturb you for the world.”</p>

<p>It may reasonably be conjectured that the annoyed Mrs.
Severing did not follow this filial advice.</p>

<p>The ensuing days at Pensevern were pleasant neither to
Nina nor to her son.</p>

<p>Morris played the piano stormily, and Nina, wincing perceptibly,
said:</p>

<p>“Don’t, Morris. It jars horribly to hear that banging.
Your touch is not at all improved.”</p>

<p>“The ‘light trills and runs’ of the eighties are altogether
out of keeping with modern music, mother.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, is that what you call modern music, my poor
boy? <i>I</i> should simply call it strumming. But I suppose,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
said Nina with an annoying laugh, “that you like to call it
<i>improvization</i>.”</p>

<p>“Like!” said her son with gloomy scorn, unable to think
of a better retort. “I don’t suppose I shall ever like anything
again.”</p>

<p>He flung out of the room.</p>

<p>Most of his days might be said to be spent in this exercise,
resorted to at ever shortening intervals, until finally the
time came when he prefaced it by a definite statement:</p>

<p>“Mother, this is no good. I must go away.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Morris. You know I’m used to being alone.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know it is lonely for you in a way, especially
since Mrs. Tregaskis has left Porthlew——”</p>

<p>“Very lonely,” repeated Nina with a patient smile. “But
I shall make some music, Morris, and read a good deal in
the long evenings, and then there’s the garden....”</p>

<p>Nina’s acquaintance with the garden hardly extended
beyond the kaleidoscope of herbaceous border outside the
drawing-room windows, but she liked the idea of silently
communing with Nature.</p>

<p>“I shall go to America with that concert-party,” announced
Morris, referring to certain projects of a professional
friend.</p>

<p>Nina, without the slightest warning, dissolved into tears.</p>

<p>She cried so much less becomingly than usual that Morris
was moved to quick, sudden compunction.</p>

<p>He came and knelt beside her.</p>

<p>“Darling, don’t cry. I won’t go if you hate it. But
what am I to do here? There’s no work fit for a man.”</p>

<p>Nina continued to weep.</p>

<p>Morris gazed at her with miserable perplexity. Accustomed
though he was to Nina’s easy tears, they invariably
caused him acute discomfort, and, moreover, he was conscious
of a certain feeling of remorse.</p>

<p>“Mother, don’t cry. I’ll stay if you want me, of course.”</p>

<p>“No—no—it isn’t that exactly.”</p>

<p>He watched her with growing anxiety, and felt that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
would do anything to stop her tears. In the tension of the
moment, he sought to relieve his own intense discomfort,
and at all costs to stop his mother’s weeping, by an impulsive
suggestion.</p>

<p>“Come too! Why on earth shouldn’t you? <i>The</i> Nina
Severing would be an enormous asset—you know they
love your stuff over there.”</p>

<p>He saw with thankfulness that her tears had stopped, and
hurried on eagerly:</p>

<p>“Carrol wants someone to chaperone the two girls—those
two who are going to do the violin duets, you know—and
of course your name would be an immense draw.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Morris! It’s nonsense. How could I leave this
place to look after itself?”</p>

<p>Morris became aware that his project was being met with
a tacit acceptance. Material objections had never yet
stayed any progress of Nina’s.</p>

<p>“Easily!” he declared lightly. “You’d simply love it—and
we needn’t be tied to Carrol’s show after the three
months are up. We’d come home on our own, or stay out
there for a bit.”</p>

<p>“I should be glad to leave England behind me,” said
Nina recklessly, and for no reason save the sensation of
weariness induced by tears. “And so would you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Morris declared vehemently. “Thankful. Look
here, I’m going to telegraph to Carrol and you’ll see what
an enthusiastic answer he’ll send.”</p>

<p>“<i>La vie de Bohème</i> once more!” murmured the mistress
of Pensevern, with more appreciation of the sentence than
its truth warranted. No life of Bohemia had ever been, or
ever would be, Nina Severing’s, but her son knew by the
phrase that he need fear no further display of emotion.</p>

<p>“Am I mad?” he demanded of himself outside the door
with some amazement, then characteristically shrugged his
shoulders and dismissed the thought.</p>

<p>He hated Nina’s weeping, and had chosen the first means
of consoling her which had occurred to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>It was not Morris’s way to envisage the consequence of
his own impulses until actually confronted by them, and in
the urgencies of departure both he and Nina found a salving
for many things.</p>

<p>If, in the months that ensued, neither Morris nor Nina
Severing found that a momentary common impulse was to
prove an enduring link between them, the knowledge weighed
lightly on Morris, to whom no enduring link that humanity
can forge would ever equal the glamour of a new enthusiasm.</p>

<p>To Nina, the fundamental resemblance between them
would hold out eternal lures, and promises of a new understanding.
That these should fail as often as they should
renew themselves, would never succeed in permanently disturbing
Mrs. Severing’s treasured conception of her own
motherhood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LUDOVIC ARGENT sometimes thought that the understanding
of Mrs. Tregaskis seemed hardest of
all to Rosamund. Had she anything at all left of
her very own?</p>

<p>He found himself wondering.</p>

<p>He went across the valley on many days, and Mrs. Tregaskis
always welcomed him with eager cordiality. It was
only after a time that Ludovic admitted to himself that he
sought another welcome than hers with an insistence which
surprised him vaguely. One day in the autumn his halting
step came slowly up the narrow garden path where Bertha
Tregaskis, in the short, dark tweed of determinedly unconventional
widowhood, was crouching over a border. She
raised herself briskly enough at the sound of his stick upon
the gravel.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” she cried exuberantly, showing a pair of
earthy palms. “I can’t shake hands—too grubby. But
you’ll help me tie up these poor dear things, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Ludovic adjusted his crutch-like stick, and fumbled
obediently with long pieces of bass and the top-heavy overgrown
dahlias.</p>

<p>“Rosamund is not good at this sort of job, although she
offers to help me most regularly, poor dear! But it’s not
in her line at all.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you have in old Jones or someone two or
three times a week?” said Ludovic with the more earnestness
that his own wrestlings with the bass were strangely
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>“We do have him every now and then, but I love pottering
about, and so does Minnie. We’ve practically <i>made</i> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
whole of this border—the place was in a dreadful state
when we came.”</p>

<p>Ludovic looked round the small garden.</p>

<p>“It has altered a good deal,” he conceded.</p>

<p>His voice was expressionless.</p>

<p>Bertha looked up sharply.</p>

<p>“There have been no changes to hurt her,” she said
quickly. “One understood—good heavens, yes! There
are the two tiny plots over these under those lilac bushes,
that belonged to them—Rosamund and Frances—when
they were little children. Somehow I knew that by instinct—and
why she always said wallflowers were her favourite
flowers. This place is one mass of them in the spring.
She’s not sentimental, you know, but little things like that
that are sacred to one—afterwards. And Rosamund
knows that I understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s curious,” Mrs. Tregaskis continued meditatively,
“how quickly one ‘senses’ things, when it’s a question of
a beloved child. I don’t think, though I <i>do</i> say it myself,
that any suggestion or change of mine has jarred on Rosamund.
You see, I can share in some of the associations.
I fetched them away from here as little children—and I
was here with them when their mother died—and now the
place, in a sense, is mine as well as hers. You see it’s been
a harbour of refuge for me, too, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You don’t regret Cornwall?”</p>

<p>Bertha straightened herself slowly, and faced him.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, deliberately, but very decisively.
“The love of a place is a great thing—and I’m Cornish
through and through, as you know—but, after all, other
things matter more. Little Rosamund, for instance. Oh,
it’s not only that she wanted me—wanted me to mother
and shield and comfort her, as only a child that’s bought
its own wilful experience <i>can</i> want one, but there’s the need
of giving in her, too. You know that. I rather fancy that
you, too, understand Rosamund.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>She looked at him rather enigmatically for a moment, but
Ludovic was silent.</p>

<p>“Your mother told me once that she rather wondered
if the whole thing would end in Rosamund’s becoming a
Roman Catholic, too. She made friends with a woman at
Francie’s convent.... But it won’t. Rosamund hasn’t
the religious temperament, for one thing. All she needed
was to find herself. A modern phrase, isn’t it—and one
that I rather avoid, as a rule, but it’s expressive enough.
The child had to learn proportion—and it was taught her
through the strongest thing she knew—her love for Frances.
Reality is the only medium for reality, after all. Her other
emotions and phases weren’t real, you know—not even a
sort of love affair that she had one year. But she had to
get right down to bedrock to teach her what relative values
are.”</p>

<p>Ludovic felt with an absolute conviction that Mrs. Tregaskis,
as she had said, understood indeed.</p>

<p>He wondered deeply concerning Rosamund’s acceptance
of such comprehension.</p>

<p>That the acceptance was almost matter of fact in its
completeness was evident, but it was only after a time that
he became aware of a deeper serenity underlying her tranquil
receptivities. It was not the pale serenity of resignation,
either, for he was conscious of a certain strength and
hopefulness in her outlook that differed oddly from the
atmosphere of unrest diffused by Rosamund Grantham as
he had known her a few years earlier.</p>

<p>“I’m getting much happier,” she once said to him with
laughing candour. “Not for any reason, you know, but
just because I am.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would. I’m very glad.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason for it,” repeated Rosamund thoughtfully.
“I’m horrid enough to Cousin Bertie very often, as
you know.”</p>

<p>He had seen her lose her temper in a quick, childish outburst
over a small matter that afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>“And I always thought I <i>must</i> have definite work or go
mad. You know I tried writing, and everything, and none
of it seemed right. Yet here I am, doing nothing at all,
except little tiny jobs that Cousin Bertie mostly makes for
me, and sometimes wondering if I’m justifying my existence
at all—yet the days go by very quickly.”</p>

<p>“Work will come,” said Ludovic, voicing a conviction.
“The jobs one takes up just to save one’s fancied self-respect
never seem to me to be worth while.”</p>

<p>Rosamund laughed a little.</p>

<p>“I never can remember that you’re in Parliament—but
I always think of you in connection with your writing,” she
remarked frankly.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” returned Ludovic dryly.</p>

<p>They both laughed, with the sense of companionship that
a shared laugh almost inevitably carries with it.</p>

<p>“Aha!” said Mrs. Tregaskis, at work in the garden with
Miss Blandflower, as the sounds came through the open
window. “What do you think of me as a scheming old
woman, Minnie? I can always enjoy a little match-making,
even in my dotage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Tregaskis, how can you talk so ridiculously?”
protested Minnie. “Why, you’re the youngest woman I
know. They always say a woman is only as old as she
looks.”</p>

<p>“Minnie, Minnie, don’t flatter! You know that spades
are always spades with me. But I don’t mind telling
you a little secret. I think we shall see Rosamund happy
yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Do you mean...? But I used to think—only,
of course, one can never tell——”</p>

<p>“You mean Morris. She won’t have him, my dear.
He’s not the sort of man for her—he’s too young, for one
thing. No, no—Ludovic Argent and the Wye Valley, for
Rosamund, is what <i>I</i> think. I don’t mind telling you that
I’ve thought so all along, Minnie. I like Morris—he and
I are huge chums, as you know—but ever since that boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
and girl affair at home, ages ago, I’ve always said they
weren’t suited to one another.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see what we shall see, I suppose,”
was the timorous reply of Miss Blandflower, which she
hazarded as though voicing the most startling of suggestions.</p>

<p>“It would please Sybil very much, I fancy. Of course
I know perfectly well that she wanted it to be Francie—but
I suppose Rosamund is next best, even though she isn’t
an R.C.”</p>

<p>“But then neither is he.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But poor dear Sybil has the subject on the
brain, and always fancies that her prayers will ‘convert’
him, as she calls it, one of these days. I never saw any
woman so utterly gone to pieces as Sybil—sometimes I
almost think she’s in her second childhood to hear her
babble as she does—there’s no other word for it—simply
babble.”</p>

<p>“Babble, babble, little brook,” idiotically murmured
Minnie, with a pair of garden scissors between her teeth,
and both hands full of tangled string.</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll hold that for you. No, no, not the string—the
scissors. Give them to me, Minnie, you’ll break your
teeth if you do that. Very well—but you’re only getting
it into a muddle. What was I saying?—oh, about Sybil.
Poor dear! One of the reasons that made me come here
was the thought of having her for a neighbour. We were
the greatest of friends, as girls, though there’s nearly ten
years between us. There might be twenty, now. Minnie,
whatever happens, I do pray and trust that I shall never die
at the top first, as they say. If you see any tendency to
garrulous old age, you must tell me so in good time. It’s
much the truest kindness in the long run. One would so
much rather spend one’s last few years silently.”</p>

<p>“A few more years shall roll,” was the thoughtful response
of Miss Blandflower, as she gave a final pull to the
string and scissors entanglement, which succeeded in blending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
them all inextricably together for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Bertie, in spite of her strictures on the wanderings of
Lady Argent’s mind, was not deterred from frequently
crossing the valley in search of her. She always told Rosamund
vigorously that she liked the walk.</p>

<p>“So kind of you, Bertie dear,” her hostess murmured
gratefully, “because you know how much I love seeing you,
and the pony is so very old one can’t take him out often—especially
with the bridge at the very furthest end of the
village, as it is—so exceedingly inconvenient. It used to
make poor dear Fergus so angry, but, of course, one knows
perfectly well that this is only one house, whereas a whole
village is a whole village—and was here first, besides.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have a ferry.”</p>

<p>“My dear, I never go down to the edge of the river without
thinking of St. Christopher—you know what I mean.
It wasn’t a ferry, of course, but it was all the same thing
in the end—only of course so much better than a regular
ferry. Not that I mean it would do nowadays, or for everybody—— My
dear, what <i>are</i> you laughing at? Have I
said something dreadfully profane? I am so terribly apt
to, quite without meaning it, and Ludovic always laughs
at me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tregaskis laughed too, with kindly superiority.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re in any imminent danger of serious
profanity, Sybil, and I’m sure Ludovic doesn’t. Great cheek
of me to call him Ludovic, isn’t it? and I certainly shouldn’t
dare do it to his face—but I always think of you both as
sort of relations, you know.”</p>

<p>The observation was more in the nature of a small feeler
than an accurate statement of fact, and Bertha watched for
its effect narrowly.</p>

<p>“So nice of you, dear,” said Lady Argent absently, without
a trace of meaning in her voice or manner; “and you
know I never had any sisters or brothers, so Ludovic has
never had an aunt. At least, dear Fergus had one sister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
but she was older than he was, a good deal, and so very
Scotch. Not that I mean for a moment that her being
Scotch would prevent her from being an aunt as well—in
fact, I believe the Scotch think more about relationships than
we do. Blood is thicker than water and all that, you know,
dear, and kith and kin, whatever that may mean, which I
always think sounds so very Scotch—but she really wasn’t
at all like an aunt to Ludovic. Just called him ‘my brother’s
child,’ you know, and sent him a little book from time to
time. Very Calvinistic,” and Lady Argent, shaking her
head, “and I always burnt them, even in those days, though
he was far too young to read, poor darling. In fact she
died before he was five years old.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m only too delighted to do aunt by proxy,” said
Bertha good-humouredly. “I’ve been ‘auntie’ to a good
many young people in my time, though the rising generation
generally prefers ‘Cousin Bertie.’ I remember ages ago
asking those two poor mites, Rosamund and Francie, what
they’d like to call me. D’you remember my bringing them
over here to say good-bye to you, Sybil?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, so good and pathetic, poor little dears,”
said Lady Argent tenderly; “and both so pretty, weren’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Rosamund has rather lost her looks, I’m sorry to say.”</p>

<p>Bertha was looking keenly at her friend, who remained
serenely unconscious of her scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so, Sybil?”</p>

<p>“She’s rather too thin, and I don’t like those great
shadows under her eyes, but I’m sure she’ll always be a very
pretty creature. So like her mother, you know, though I
always thought that Mrs. Grantham spoilt herself with those
enormous earrings, especially in the country, somehow. I
don’t quite know,” Lady Argent thoughtfully pursued, with
an air of far greater interest than any she had bestowed on
the subject of Rosamund’s looks, “why it is that I have
always disliked earrings. I do so hope it isn’t prejudice,
which I always think so very narrow-minded and shocking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
But I never could bear the picture of St. Cecilia that everyone
likes so much because of those great things hanging
from her ears. Sitting at the organ, dear, you know.
Though I’ve no doubt it was the fashion, and quite proper
and everything in those days, and in that country.”</p>

<p>“My dear Sybil! Surely Cecilia was a Roman virgin?
You talk as though she’d lived in some unheard of region.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never can remember quite where Tyre and
Sidon and Syracuse and all those places are,” was Lady
Argent’s rather surprising reply. “I know St. Paul was
always going there, but then he really did travel a great deal,
Bertie, even for nowadays. I never can bear to think how
dreadfully inconvenient their travelling arrangements must
have been then—though, of course, it made it all the more
meritorious.”</p>

<p>Bertha made a decided effort to turn the conversation
from channels which appeared to her unnecessarily Scriptural.</p>

<p>“It’s such a comfort to see Rosamund looking better
every day. There’s nothing like youth, my dear, when all’s
said and done. After all, in spite of the grief and trouble
which seem so bitter to them, they have everything to look
forward to—all like before them. It’s a wonderful thing
to be young, Sybil.”</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>“I always think that it <i>depends</i> so much,” said Lady
Argent cryptically, and with the diffidence which she always
brought to any opinion that differed from her friend’s.
“But, of course, when I think of Frances, poor little darling,
though I can’t think why I call her poor, for she’s far better
off than we are, and must have a much higher place in
Heaven than one can ever hope for oneself—but there it
is, Bertie, I am quite sure that she was a very privileged
soul in every possible way.”</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to shock you,” declared Bertha with a
kind of deliberate enjoyment in her tone, “but I should
have had a much higher opinion of Frances if she’d given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
up her own way and stayed quietly at home until she was
of an age to judge for herself. Oh yes, my dear, I know
it’s a dreadful thing to say now, but I’m nothing if not outspoken,
as you know, and I can’t pretend—it isn’t in me.
One looks upon Francie as a little victim, and so she was,
poor child, but it was all owing to her own self-will.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent flushed, looked doubtful, and then said
gently and very characteristically:</p>

<p>“So brave of you, Bertie dear, to be so unconventional
and say it all out, because of course I know you loved
her just as if she’d been your very own. Only you know
it really was a vocation, if ever there was one, and Father
Anselm was very much impressed with her, and told me so
himself long before there was any question of her entering.
Such a very holy man, Bertie, and extremely clever. Plain
chant, you know, and all that kind of thing—so wonderful,
I always think, though of course I’m no judge at all, since
I never really like good music—only tunes I’ve known all
my life, which are not plain chant at all, as you may imagine,
since they’ve only revived it quite within the last few years.
The Holy Father wishes it so much, for the Church, which
of course makes one like it, though I always think otherwise,
it might strike one as the least little bit dreary. So
very little tune, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you mean. Sybil, do you know
you’re getting very discursive?”</p>

<p>“I dare say, dear,” said Lady Argent placidly, “a train
of thought is such a very difficult thing to follow, I always
think—I mean another person’s, of course. One’s own is
naturally easy enough.”</p>

<p>Bertha did not look as though she shared this conviction—nor
did she where the tangled skein of Lady Argent’s
meditations was concerned.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little train of thought in my own head at the
present moment,” she said tentatively. “I wonder if you
can guess what I’m at, Sybil.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, I’m sure I can’t. I never was the least bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
of good at guessing anything at all. Don’t you remember
when riddles were so much the fashion, and people were
always asking one why did Rider Haggard, and ridiculous
questions of that sort? I never could get the answers right,
even then, and there was one dreadful thing that dear Fergus
was so fond of—about a ton of lead and a ton of feathers.
I’m sure you must have heard it, Bertie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so—a ton of lead? Are you sure you
don’t mean a herring and a half?” laughed Bertha.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, though I know that one too. The question,
I mean—not the answer, of course. But this was something
about a ton of lead and a ton of feathers being upset
out of a boat or somewhere, into the sea, and which would
sink fastest. And, of course, I always answered ‘Lead.’
Because one knows perfectly well that feathers float and
lead sinks. But it always turned out to be the wrong
answer.”</p>

<p>“My dear Sybil!” Bertie laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Lady Argent, still in melancholy
retrospect, “I once thought I would be very clever and surprise
Fergus—so silly, my dear, because nothing ever surprised
dear Fergus, not even when one of the mares had
twin foals—he said he’d always expected it all along, which
one knows was quite impossible, but so very Scotch of him,
wasn’t it? Anyhow, one day I thought I’d get that dreadful
riddle answered once and for all, so instead of saying as one
naturally would, and as I’m bound to say I’d said quite a
dozen times before, that of course the lead would sink
soonest, I suddenly said: The feathers. And I dare say it
served me quite right, because I certainly didn’t in the least
see how it could be the right answer, and was only pretending,
which I suppose was rather hypocritical of me—but
Fergus simply roared with laughter, and told everybody
what I’d said for weeks and weeks afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Sybil, Sybil, you’ll be the death of me.” Bertha was
absolutely mopping her eyes, streaming from her unaffected
merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>Lady Argent looked at her affectionately.</p>

<p>“Dear Bertie, I do like to hear your laugh again.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> an infectious chuckle, I believe,” returned Mrs.
Tregaskis; “but I’ve always had a huge appreciation for
the funny side of things. It’s helped me all through life,
Sybil. I’m not an irreligious woman, though my religion
is perhaps not a conventional one, but I really believe the
whole of my creed could be embodied in one word:
‘Smile!’ I <i>do</i> believe in smiling! It cheers others, helps
oneself, and does good all round. I don’t mind owning to
you that a good many people, one way and another, have
told me they blessed my knack of smiling. I’m sure one
laugh is worth ten sermons, very often!”</p>

<p>“Sermons are so often a little difficult to understand,”
said Lady Argent apologetically. “I sometimes find myself
quite hazy in church—though I dare say that’s mostly from
the long drive, which makes me so dreadfully sleepy.”</p>

<p>“You have to go all the way to Chepstow, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and dear Ludovic is so angelic about driving me
in. Not that he often allows me to go early, but then
that’s because he thinks it tires me, not because he minds
the distance.”</p>

<p>“Your relationship is a very beautiful one,” said Bertha
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, it is!” cried Lady Argent very simply.
“I often wonder what I’ve done to deserve a son like
Ludovic, when I see how dreadfully other people are worried
by their children.”</p>

<p>She coloured suddenly at the allusion, and then hurried
on. “It’s not because I’ve brought him up beautifully or
anything of that sort, either. I never <i>could</i> have theories,
though I bought hundreds of little books—from the very
first day that I knew I was going to have a baby. But I
always forgot, and then dear Fergus, who was nothing if
not determined—so very Scotch, you know, dear—used
to say that little books were all rubbish, and if I wanted to
know how to bring up a child, Solomon had said all there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
was to be said upon the subject. Not that he would ever
have laid a finger upon Ludovic himself, you know. The
only time the poor darling was ever punished, when he was
about six years old, I had to do it myself, with a bedroom
slipper. And I cried so dreadfully that Ludovic said in the
middle of it: ‘It’s all right, mummy, don’t cry, you’re
hardly hurting me at all.’ So touching, I always thought.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes think that bringing up hasn’t anything at
all to do with it,” said Bertha dryly. “I brought up my
own child as well as I knew how, and practically brought
up the other two girls as well. And look at my Hazel, Sybil.
She hasn’t one thought for me. She came home when her
father died and stayed a week—and her husband came for
one night. She was sweet enough and affectionate enough—Hazel’s
always been that—but do you suppose that I
didn’t know that the whole of her thoughts were at Marleswood,
with Guy and the babies, after the first day or two
were over? Perhaps it’s natural—but it’s very bitter,
Sybil. I don’t ask for impossibilities—I couldn’t have
lived with them, and I should never wish to—but they never
even suggested it.”</p>

<p>Lady Argent said nothing at all, and took Bertha’s hand
into hers.</p>

<p>“It’s the fuss over her marriage that she’s never forgotten,”
said Bertha bitterly, “and yet God knows she can
afford to. She’s taken her own way, and is happy in it—and
her father and I forgave her long ago, if she wanted
forgiveness, for her self-will and disobedience.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bertha at last, “Rosamund is the only one
who has come back to the old nest after all. Hazel’s gone
right away from me—I know that well enough, in spite of
all her loving letters—and won’t ever come back. Little
Francie took her own way and followed a will-o’-the-wisp
that she thought was the Star in the East, and I tell you,
Sybil, that before she’d been in that place six months she
was just as remote and far away from us as though she’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
been in another world. Why, her very language wasn’t ours
any longer—her whole scale of values had shifted....
Someone who saw her once after she had entered told me
it was like talking to someone with a thick wall of impenetrable
glass all round. You could see her—but you could
never get near ... never be in touch again....”</p>

<p>“You are nearer now, perhaps,” softly said Lady Argent.</p>

<p>“Who knows? But the child that’s come back to me is
Rosamund. And I shan’t fail her, Sybil.”</p>

<p>“No, Bertie,” said Lady Argent lovingly. “You would
never fail her.”</p>

<p>“Never,” repeated Bertha with curiously intense conviction.
“You see, apart from everything else, she’s the one of
the three that has sought me when other things failed her.
It’s an appeal that one doesn’t forget. I have to <i>give</i>, you
know, Sybil. I’m made that way—and Rosamund has
every claim on me.”</p>

<p>There was silence again, and Bertha only broke it to
take her departure with a brisk matter-of-factness that
seemed to draw a swift curtain across some intimate threshold
to a sanctuary where even her own footsteps seldom
penetrated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HAZEL and the babies are coming for a week,”
announced Bertha triumphantly.</p>

<p>“How delightful! But oh! dear Mrs. Tregaskis,
<i>have</i> you considered where you’re going to put
them?” urgently demanded Miss Blandflower, wearing an
expression of anxiety.</p>

<p>“Ask my landlady, Minnie.”</p>

<p>Miss Blandflower’s expression, now complicated by the
addition of a puzzled smile, was turned towards Rosamund.</p>

<p>“The little balcony room for Hazel, of course, and the
spare room is quite large enough for nurse and the baby—but
Dickie——”</p>

<p>“He can have a cot in my room,” said Dickie’s grandmother
quickly, “unless Hazel wants him with her. What
about a nursery? They’ll be out most of the day, in this
glorious weather, but it gets dark early; and then for
meals——”</p>

<p>“There’s the attic,” said Rosamund rather slowly. “It’s
very big and light, and can easily be cleared. It used to
be a sort of nursery.”</p>

<p>She remained a moment reflective, and Mrs. Tregaskis
eyed her kindly and observantly.</p>

<p>“Fancy!” ejaculated Minnie in the silence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosamund. “It makes a very nice room,
and there are two windows.” She thought to herself that
she would rather like the attic, where she and Francie had
played together, to be a nursery again.</p>

<p>“You’d rather like it to be a nursery again, wouldn’t
you?” said Bertha gently.</p>

<p>The attic was made ready, and two days later the engaging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
Dickie was trotting round it and gazing through the
big dormer windows on to the garden below.</p>

<p>Hazel, radiantly pretty and good-humoured, showed the
caressing appreciation and gratitude for the welcome prepared
that Rosamund had never known her fail to bestow.
She played with the babies, gardened with Minnie, and
answered all Bertha’s half-tentative questions with the same
joyous unreserve of manner. If, in that very unreserve,
there was a withholding, Rosamund thought it a most unconscious
one. To Rosamund, Hazel gave of her loving
way and impulses freely. Above all, she gave her, by a sort
of tender instinct, what Rosamund needed most—the care
of Dickie.</p>

<p>It was Dickie who, unknowing enough, completed what
Mrs. Mulholland, with her kind, inadequate goodness, had
begun after Frances’ death.</p>

<p>Rosamund came to realize that, on the day that she received
news of Mrs. Mulholland’s death. She was in the
garden with Ludovic Argent, as so often now, under the big
Spanish chestnut from which still hung, stained and creaking,
the frayed ropes and wide seat of the swing that had
belonged to her and to Frances.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mulholland is dead,” she said, with wet eyes.
“She just died in her sleep, on Sunday night. They’ve
written from the convent to tell me.”</p>

<p>She handed him the letter quite simply.</p>

<p>Ludovic read the rather set, conventional phrases in which
a French nun asked Rosamund’s prayers for the repose of
the soul of her old friend.</p>

<p>She had been “ready to go” for a long while.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ludovic, “I remember you told me about
that.”</p>

<p>“She wondered what the meeting with her husband would
be like—after all those years. She talked of dying just
as though it was like going on a journey, to some place where
people one knew were waiting. She was very matter-of-fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
about it. I think Catholics are like that. She said she
would take messages from me to Frances—in a sort of
way it comforted me very much. It made it seem—not so
very far away, after all. I wonder.”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and then said almost timidly:</p>

<p>“Do you think perhaps she’s given the messages now?”</p>

<p>“Who knows, my dear?” said Ludovic Argent gently.</p>

<p>Watching Rosamund, whose gaze was turned to the dim
outline of the Welsh hills, he knew that he loved her, and
told himself that he had always known it.</p>

<p>Presently he told her.</p>

<p>“I think I am not capable of any very strong feeling any
more,” said Rosamund almost childishly, and half apologetically.
“I had to tell Morris that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t care for him?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Rosamund.</p>

<p>“Then may I try to make you care for me?”</p>

<p>“Ludovic, I’ll try and explain,” said Rosamund, speaking
with difficulty, and using his name for the first time. “It
has seemed to me that there is only one way for anyone to
learn anything—and that is through caring. Francie’s
love for God, whether one thinks it a mistaken sort or not,
made her give up everything and go to the convent—as
you know. And it nearly broke my heart, because it took
her away from me, and I wanted her to be happy in my way
and with me. When I went to see her after she’d actually
entered I knew that in some way she’d grown up, while I
hadn’t—I was still muddling about in chaos, while she’d
found a definite anchor. I couldn’t understand, and I felt
further away from her than ever before. Then, when I
went to the convent when she was ill, and they wouldn’t let
me go to her, I understood all she’d given up. You see, for
<i>Francie</i> to do or say anything that would hurt <i>me</i> was the
greatest sacrifice that she could ever have offered. When I
was in the chapel then, I prayed that she might die....</p>

<p>“It was all such pain and despair as I can’t describe—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span> 
afterwards, very slowly, I think I’ve understood a little.
There is only one thing which counts, and that’s loving—and
loving is giving.</p>

<p>“Frances gave one way—her way—and taught me a
very little of what it meant.</p>

<p>“But my way is not the same as hers.”</p>

<p>“You are giving the things of the spirit,” said Ludovic.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Rosamund with a sort of sob.
“But it’s the only way of feeling that Francie and I are not
so very far apart after all.”</p>

<p>From the garden below came the voices of Hazel’s children,
Dickie calling in a shrill, sweet treble.</p>

<p>Rosamund gave a sudden smile, and then it died from
her eyes in a rush of overwhelming loneliness.</p>

<p>Ludovic’s need was urgent, and he took his advantage.</p>

<p>“Rosamund,” he said entreatingly.</p>

<p>Her gaze did not leave the far line of the horizon, but
very slowly, without turning her head, she gave him her
hand.</p>
